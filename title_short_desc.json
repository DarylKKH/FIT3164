[{"title":"Melania Trump Is First Catholic to Live in White House Since JFK","content":"After Melania Trump met with Pope Francis in the Vatican Wednesday, her spokeswoman confirmed that the First Lady is indeed a Roman Catholic, the first to occupy her post since Jackie Kennedy. [The last time the United States had a Catholic as First Lady was during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, whose wife Jackie Kennedy \u2014  like him \u2014  was a Roman Catholic. When Melania moves into the White House together with their son Barron this summer, she will become the first Catholic occupant of the White House since the Kennedy era.  On meeting the Pope Wednesday, Melania asked him to bless her rosary and later visited the Bambin Ges\u00f9 (Baby Jesus) pediatric hospital, where she met with young patients and their families, prayed in a chapel and laid flowers at the feet of a statue of the Virgin Mary.  Later that day, the First Lady\u2019s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham confirmed to DailMail. com that Melania is a practicing Catholic. Having grown up in Slovenia, then part of the Communist and officially atheist Soviet bloc, it is unclear when Melania was baptized a Catholic. President Trump is a   Presbyterian, and he and Melania were married in a Palm Beach Florida Episcopal church. Melania\u2019s father was a nominal member of the Communist Party in order to be able to obtain employment. In February, Melania kicked off a presidential rally in Melbourne, Florida, by reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, beginning with the typical Catholic invocation \u201cLet us pray. \u201d The first lady later tweeted about the development with the hashtags \u201c#Blessings\u201d and \u201c#Faith. \u201d In another tweet, she sent \u201cblessings to all\u201d after her audience with the pontiff, which she described as an \u201chonor\u201d she will never forget.

Mr. Trump, speaking in a   interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a   legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. \u201cInfrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. \u201cInfrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. \u201d The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on   and   real estate development, has proposed eliminating an   infrastructure program that would have funded   proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region\u2019s infrastructure and transit systems. Mr. Trump said he planned to examine both New York projects and submit them to an   unformed \u201ccommission\u201d headed by Richard LeFrak, a fellow scion of a prominent Queens real estate family, and Steven Roth, the chairman of the New   Vornado Realty Trust. \u201cWell, I may support them,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at them. \u201d \u201cI did great in real estate in New York,\u201d he added. \u201cI know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I\u2019m setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. \u201d New York leaders were not impressed. \u201cWelcome to the party,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. \u201cThe governor has been saying that we need to rebuild our airports for years, but unlike Washington, we aren\u2019t just talking about needed improvements we are already in the process of rebuilding them. This is exactly why the federal government needs to follow through on its promise to fund infrastructure projects. \u201d Mitchell Moss, the director of New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, predicted that Mr. Trump, spurred on by his daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner, would eventually come through for the city. \u201c   is a nice place to golf, but New York is where Donald Trump grew up, and it\u2019s where he will return,\u201d Mr. Moss said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort. \u201cAt the end of the day, Donald, Ivanka and Jared are going to come back here, and they know the city needs a   infrastructure. \u201d It is not that the president thinks the city is not in need. \u201cI think it\u2019s in poor shape,\u201d he said of New York\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cThe highways are in poor shape. \u201d \u201cI think the airports are a horror show,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled the world, I know the world. \u201d Mr. Trump, whose knowledge of complex policy issues can sometimes be lacking, then offered a scathing critique of the bent and battered metal median guards on the Van Wyck Expressway not far from his childhood home in Queens. \u201cWhoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman,\u201d he said, as his aides  \u2014   who wanted to talk about their bigger plans  \u2014   grew restless in their carved armchairs. \u201cThat is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It\u2019s the worst garbage. And I also think it\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you\u2019re driving, you\u2019ve got yourself a problem. \u201d Mr. Trump confessed that he had not personally driven in a while, and that it had been years since he had ridden the subway. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the subway system very well. I used to take it to   School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I\u2019d take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago. I\u2019d take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars. \u201d Referring to his parents, he added, \u201cThey weren\u2019t thrilled when they heard that. \u201d Mr. Trump, at the advice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, had intended to tackle health care first  \u2014   gaining hundreds of billions of dollars in cost savings  \u2014   that would then be rolled into an ambitious tax cut package. Infrastructure, according to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other top administration officials, was something the administration would handle when the other two bills were passed. But the health care debacle has scuttled the president\u2019s plans, and he is considering merging one or all of the proposals in the hopes of cobbling together a coalition. The idea of merging a big infrastructure plan with a tax proposal is not new: Shortly after taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a similar idea  \u2014   and his stimulus package included more than $300 billion in tax breaks intended to spur infrastructure and capital investments to stimulate growth. Mr. Trump is confident he will attract Democratic support  \u2014   even though he has not spoken with the minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, for weeks. He said Democrats were \u201cdesperate for infrastructure  \u2014   that\u2019s the thing that they want. \u201d Mr. Schumer said he was eager to start negotiations but not especially hopeful. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t put out anything specific yet,\u201d the senator said. The president, surrounded by staff members including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Reed Cordish, an assistant to Mr. Trump  \u2014   refused to say how much direct public funding would be included in his proposal. A senior administration official directly involved in drafting the plan said that number would be in the $200 billion to $300 billion range over the next decade, with the balance of the package paid for by tax credits. Mr. Schumer and many congressional Democrats say they will never agree to such large tax breaks for developers and builders, despite the president\u2019s claim that they will fold. And even as Mr. Trump trumpeted the curative political tonic of the infrastructure bill, his aides were on hand to remind him that they had their own priorities, too. \u201cHe\u2019s spending an enormous amount of time on trade and taxes,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, interrupting the talk of trains, planes and automobiles. \u201cThose are two big areas. \u201d A few minutes later, Mr. Cohn  \u2014   who is ascendant in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle  \u2014   let out a colossal sneeze. Perhaps that is why the president paid such close attention to Mr. Cohn\u2019s physical  . \u201cGod bless you. You O. K. Gary?\u201d the president said. \u201cThat was a pretty tough one. I\u2019ve got to make sure my man is all right. \u201d","short_description":"President Trump considers accelerating infrastructure bill but does not confirm funding for New York City transportation projects.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"New cold war: US Marines\u2019 Norway war games","content":"Kirkenes, Norway (CNN) An American tank full of US Marines crashes through the silence of the   pine forest around Bardufoss, far above the Arctic Circle, as unidentified drones hover overhead and yellow and green smoke fills the freezing air.

Would they like to talk to the soldiers? \u201dProbably, but it\u2019s illegal.\u201d There are two strategies intended to deter a Crimea scenario in Norway:  Firstly, the presence of armored vehicles, which would enable them to confront the little green men effectively, and would force their backers, Russia, to introduce armored vehicles into the conflict, making it clear that any attacking forces have state backing.  Secondly, the presence of US Marines, ensuring that any interference in Norwegian territory automatically involves the United States in the fight.

Harward, the retired vice admiral who is President Trump\u2019s top choice to replace his ousted national security adviser, is a   member of the Navy SEALs who rose through the ranks to top military positions and is close with Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense. Mr. Harward, 60, is a former deputy commander of the United States Central Command, the military\u2019s busiest with management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, where he was responsible for counterterrorism issues. He is currently a top executive at Lockheed Martin, the weapons and aerospace company, overseeing business with the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Harward\u2019s career has closely tracked that of Mr. Mattis, from the time the two worked together in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 to his tour at Central Command from 2011 to 2013, which included an assignment heading detainee operations in Kabul. \u201cHe has faced down and defeated the world\u2019s most ruthless and deadly enemies, and he has done all that by Mattis\u2019s side,\u201d said Fran Townsend, Mr. Bush\u2019s former homeland security adviser, for whom Mr. Harward worked from 2003 to 2005. \u201cHe has been in tougher knife fights than this, and won. \u201d Still, it is not clear whether Mr. Harward would be willing to surrender his lucrative position and comfortable existence in Abu Dhabi to step into the tumult of the Trump White House. The new administration has been troubled by an unusual level of infighting, disorganization and grievance  \u2014   including within the ranks of the National Security Council  \u2014   capped off on Monday by the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. Raised in prerevolutionary Tehran, Mr. Harward was known to startle his Afghan counterparts during his tours there by conversing with them fluently in Farsi, which is similar to their native Dari. Trained as an elite Special Operations officer, Mr. Harward is also known for his bravado and obsession with physical fitness. As the head of detainee operations in Afghanistan, he would lead weekly hikes in the mountains outside Kabul, outpacing colleagues who were 20 years younger, and has been known to challenge them to   contests that left them vomiting. Mr. Harward looks the part of a   military man, a crucial factor for a president who has made clear that he considers appearance an important indicator of a job candidate\u2019s suitability for a role. With his bald head,   eyes and long scar of mysterious provenance down his cheek, Mr. Harward has the bearing of an officer who once carried out risky secret operations. But he is also an effective inside player, according to people who know him, having worked for some of the military\u2019s top policy leaders and at the White House. James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former NATO commander, said Mr. Harward was \u201csomeone who will find a way to succeed no matter how daunting the task. \u201d \u201cI have known him well for two decades, and have boundless admiration for his ingenuity, integrity and ability to navigate choppy seas  \u2014   both operationally in the field and in the battlefield of Washington, D. C.,\u201d said Mr. Stavridis, currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \u201cThe real question,\u201d he added, \u201cis whether he wants to take the job. \u201d Some question whether Mr. Harward\u2019s decades of military experience are the right preparation for a senior   post. In a Twitter post Tuesday, Max Boot, a senior fellow in national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Harward \u201ca great SEAL,\u201d but said it was \u201cnot clear that running detainee ops in Afghanistan or being No 2 at Centcom is right background for this. \u201d Friends say Mr. Harward has experience with   military special operations, but also in navigating the arcane world of the National Security Council, which is charged with synthesizing recommendations from national security and intelligence agencies and advising the president on policy. The process frequently involves managing turf battles and balancing competing interests. \u201cHe\u2019ll bring a buffering calm and balance, as well as his using his previous experience at the N. S. C. ,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise, a former deputy director at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Mr. Mattis is widely seen as a force for steadiness within the Trump administration, and some Republicans who have expressed misgivings about the president\u2019s policies and his attitude toward national security matters have looked to his defense secretary as an island of reliability in a sea of unpredictability. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump should name a new national security adviser \u201cwho is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government. \u201d Mr. McCain said he looked forward \u201cto working with the president\u2019s administration, especially Secretary Mattis, to defend the nation and support our military service members. \u201d If he is chosen for the post and accepts, Mr. Harward would be reunited with his old boss and mentor, Mr. Mattis. But he would also have to contend with Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, populated by political advisers with whom Mr. Harward is not familiar, including Steven K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist. In an executive order last month  \u2014   which Mr. Trump later complained privately that he had not been fully briefed on  \u2014   the president placed Mr. Bannon on the principals committee of the National Security Council, giving a political adviser a position of parity with the secretaries of state and defense, and with the national security adviser. Two former national security officials who have worked closely with Mr. Harward said he would be unlikely to take the position without strong assurances from Mr. Trump and his team that the council would not be driven by partisan considerations on national security policy, and that he would have the autonomy to provide principled counsel.

After spending so many months toying around with his faux populist agenda, now the White House is really getting down to business. Coming at the end of this   mark, President Trump\u2019s dramatic proposal to cut corporate tax rates from 35% to 15% slashing individual rates, eliminating the alternative minimum tax, and abolishing the estate and gift tax  signals that he understands where his bread is buttered, and that is by the Republican majorities on Capitol Hill.  Of all the moves that he could possibly make, including the failed attempt at repealing Obamacare or the infamous border wall,   tax cuts are the most effective way for him to solidify his partisan support, which will be important to his future success with legislation and the possibility of  .   Tax cuts have been bread and butter for Republicans since the conservative revolution that rocked American politics in the 1970s. Along with   few issues have energized Republicans like dismantling the   progressive individual and corporate income tax system put into place in the early 20th century. Conservatives made a number of arguments about why taxes should be cut on the wealthy. \u201dSupply side\u201d economists claimed that if the government freed up upper income earners and business with lower marginal tax rates, investment would start to flow and everyone would benefit.  Other conservatives stressed that progressive taxes were unfair, a symbol of big government, and lowering them was the most effective way to put a stake in the heart of big government liberalism.  Just because wealthier people and organizations earned more than the middle class, it was not fair that the government should be required to pay a higher rate than lower income Americans.    Tax cuts skewed toward the upper income brackets play with well with the business and financial community that have often been big supporters of the GOP.  In addition, shrewd conservatives like David Stockman, who served as President Reagan\u2019s budget director, championed the \u201dstarve the beast\u201d argument. It\u2019s a losing argument to convince Americans that government programs which they perceive as providing benefits should be cut. So if the Republicans wanted to shrink government programs, their best bet was to lower tax revenues, making less money available to Washington for spending. For decades, Republican presidents have made tax cuts a priority. President Reagan pushed through a historic tax cut in the summer of 1981 that lowered the top rate from 70% to 50% for individuals and lowered corporate income taxes by over $150 billion. \u201dNo other issue,\u201d Reagan said, \u201dgoes so directly to the heart of our economic life.\u201d In 1986, he worked with Democrats in Congress to pass   tax reform in exchange for lowering rates once again. President George W. Bush did the same in 2001 with a $1. 3 trillion reduction (including the elimination of the estate tax) ending the era of federal surpluses that started under President Clinton, and again in 2003 even though the US was in the middle of a war. Bill Plante of CBS News recalled that \u201dthe younger Bush went around telling people, \u2019Look, I\u2019m more like Ronald Reagan than my father.\u201d  Indeed, the big exception to GOP   was President George H. W. Bush, who despite lowering the capital gains tax accepted tax increases as part of the 1990 deficit reduction plan. He paid the price. Conservatives like Congressman Newt Gingrich, future speaker of the House, never forgave him. And he wasn\u2019t able to win a second term in his race against Bill Clinton. It took some time for President Trump to get to the tax plan, but now it looks like he is going to send conservatives what they want.    While there are many economists who don\u2019t believe that this tax cut would have beneficial consequences over the long term, especially by bursting deficits that will strain the nation, politically this could be a winning proposal.  Coming at a time when many Republican legislators are itching to deliver an important victory, this would have great appeal to the traditional constituencies of the Republican Party. The corporate world, still uneasy with Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric and attacks on free trade, might be a big more comfortable once they are delivered this benefit. And as Presidents Reagan and Bush realized, there are ways to package   tax cuts with rhetoric and targeted sweeteners so that working class conservatives believe they will be sharing a piece of this economic pie. Even though there is a lot of grumbling among Republicans about the impact on the deficits and proposals such as eliminating the deductions for state and local taxes, which will hit New York and California residents hard, Reagan also had trouble moving his tax bill in 1981. After the assassination attempt on his life, Reagan came back and mounted a   public relations blitz that was effective. Most Republicans who opposed him backed off. Democrats ended up adding provisions to the bill (compared to Christmas Tree ornaments) that benefited middle class Americans rather than trying to block it altogether.  It will be difficult for Democrats to fight back against President Trump\u2019s proposals. While the House and Senate Democrats have found considerable room to obstruct and say no to President Trump, standing against tax cuts has often been one place the party feels vulnerable. They all remember when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale admitted in 1984 that if elected he would raise taxes, which gave President Reagan ample material to attack. Democratic senators from swing states will be uneasy taking a stand against tax cuts, even if they believe them to be irresponsible, for fearing of giving their opponents a powerful issue to campaign on. Unlike some of the other issues thus far, like refugee bans and health care, this is an issue that President Trump can\u2019t afford to lose. This is one of the principal demands from Republicans of their president and it is an issue where the political dynamics in an era of united government point to success. This, more than anything, will give us a measure of what he can do on Capitol Hill.  If President Trump can get the tax cut back to his desk for a signature, this could be an important turning point in his policy agenda after the early turbulent months of legislating. Just this one victory, which would be a big one politically, could give him and the Republicans more than they need to take onto the campaign trail in 2018 and 2020 as they aim to keep control of Washington.

Ledecky\u2019s final margin of victory was 11. 38 seconds over Britain\u2019s Jazz Carlin, who clocked a 8:16. 17,   of a second better than Hungary\u2019s Boglarka Kapas. Here\u2019s how Ledecky broke the record. The favorites in the other marquee events didn\u2019t fare as well. Katinka Hosszu, who had already won three golds in Rio, was chased down by American Maya DiRado in the   backstroke. Hosszu led for the first 180 meters. DiRado caught her near the wall and touched it first, finishing in 2 minutes 05. 99 seconds. Hosszu\u2019s time was 2:06. 05. It was second gold medal, and fourth over all, at the Rio Games for DiRado, 23. Here\u2019s how DiRado did it. And somebody finally beat Michael Phelps in Rio. His name\u2019s Joseph Schooling, and he topped Phelps in the   butterfly. Read about how he beat Phelps here. An Egyptian judoka declined to shake hands with his Israeli opponent after their match on Friday, eliciting jeers from the audience. Or Sasson of Israel defeated Islam El Shehaby of Egypt in a   match in the heaviest weight class. After a moment of prayer, El Shehaby got up and seemed reluctant to perform the traditional bow to his opponent. Eventually, he gave a quick nod and left the mat. A judge and referee urged him to return. Sasson then approached El Shehaby with his hand extended, but El Shehaby backed away. After a moment, Sasson gave up. \u201cThat is extremely rare in judo,\u201d the American coach Jimmy Pedro said. \u201cIt is especially disrespectful considering it was a clean throw and a fair match. It was completely dishonorable and totally unsportsmanlike on the part of the Egyptian. \u201d Sasson went on to win a bronze medal in the event, which was won by the French legend Teddy Riner.

Hope Solo blasted the Swedish team after the loss, saying they had played like \u201ca bunch of cowards. \u201d \u2022 The first medal event at track and field was a memorable one as Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia broke the world record in the women\u2019s 10, 000 meters by more than 14 seconds. Ayana, 24, finished in 29 minutes 17. 45 seconds, ahead of the previous mark of 29:31. 78, set by Wang Junxia of China in 1993. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya was a distant second, at 29:32. 53. Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, who won the past two Olympic   races, took bronze. \u2022 Six Olympics for Kim Rhode, and now six Olympic medals. Rhode, 37, won a bronze medal in skeet shooting on Friday. Rhode had won a gold medal in the double trap event at age 17 at the Atlanta Olympics and added a medal at every Summer Games since. Her six medals tie Jackie   for most individual Olympic medals by a United States woman. \u2022 The American men\u2019s foil fencing team won a bronze medal on Friday, the first medal for the United States in the event since 1932. Alexander Massialas was the silver medalist in the individual event, and Miles   has a flamboyant fencing move named after him, but it was another member of the team, Gerek Meinhardt, who was the key.

The final score was  . \u201cI didn\u2019t fence great against Egypt and Russia,\u201d Meinhardt said, of the day\u2019s earlier matches. \u201cFinally I broke through. Frustration motivated me. \u201d The substitute Race Imboden rounded out the American team. He fought just one bout but won,   and hollered at the audience in delight. The same four fencers had finished in the dreaded fourth position in London in 2012. Imboden said the   camaraderie between the fencer was crucial to their success. \u201cWe\u2019ve all known each other since we\u2019ve been 10 years old. \u201d After the victory,   gave Imboden a piggyback ride as the delighted team celebrated. \u2022 The   butterfly is the 18th and final individual event of Michael Phelps\u2019s career. Although with Phelps, you never know. He will try to win his fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the event, a feat he accomplished in the   individual medley on Thursday. With a victory in the 800 freestyle, Katie Ledecky will become the second swimmer, joining Debbie Meyer in 1968, to win the 200, 400 and   freestyles in the same Olympics. Anthony Ervin, 35, is the oldest member of the United States swim team. If he can win the   freestyle, he will supplant Phelps as the oldest swimmer to win individual Olympic gold.

The Americans probably won\u2019t hit the snooze alarm against Serbia. The U. S. women take on Canada. Simone Manuel managed to make history and break a record, all in less than a minute. Manuel became the first   woman to win an individual event in Olympic swimming on Thursday night. She and Penny Oleksiak of Canada tied for the fastest time, an Olympic record in the women\u2019s   freestyle: 52. 70 seconds. \u201cI definitely think it raises some awareness and will get them inspired,\u201d Manuel, 20, said about the significance of her accomplishment. \u201cI mean, the gold medal wasn\u2019t just for me. It was for people that came before me and inspired me to stay in the sport. For people who believe that they can\u2019t do it, I hope I\u2019m an inspiration to others to get out there and try swimming. You might be pretty good at it. \u201d Manuel is sharing a room with another   American swimmer, Katie Ledecky, in the athletes\u2019 village here. She and Oleksiak shaved 0. 01 seconds off the Olympic standard of 52. 71, set earlier in the Rio Games meet by Australia\u2019s Cate Campbell. Sweden\u2019s Sarah Sjostrom won the bronze in 52. 99. There has been a great deal of frustration this at the Rio Games, where the table tennis balls are giving players fits. They don\u2019t bounce true, the players said. Their flight paths are unpredictable. And they frequently break. \u201cI think this ball is very bad,\u201d Li Ping of Qatar said after losing a match.

Biles Claims the Crown: In case anybody had doubts, Simone Biles made it official: she\u2019s the best gymnast in the world. The American dominated the women\u2019s   competition on her way to a gold medal Thursday. In doing so, she joined Mary Lou Retton, Carly Patterson, Nastia Liukin and Gabby Douglas as American   winners. Aly Raisman (U. S.) won the silver, and Aliya Mustafina (Russia) won bronze. Read about Biles\u2019s gold medal performance here. See the moves she pulled off here. Phelps Breaks an Ancient Record: Michael Phelps won the 200 individual medley easily, beating not only teammate Ryan Lochte, but an ancient Greek. Leonidas of Rhodes won 12 individual events over four Olympics. At 36, five years older than Phelps, he won his last three golds in 152 B. C. in races of about 200 and 400 meters and in a   race. It wasn\u2019t easy, but Phelps surpassed Leonidas, winning his 13th individual gold (and 22nd gold overall and 26th medal). With the victory, Phelps also joined the track and field Olympians Al Oerter and Carl Lewis as the only Americans to win an individual event four times. Phelps was timed in 1 minute 54. 66. He won by over a bodylength, and the time was his   ever behind a 1:54. 23 from Beijing. He held up four fingers afterward to indicate his four consecutive victories in the event.

[The good news, in the deputy director\u2019s estimation, is that much of the information disclosed by Snowden is becoming obsolete. \u201cThe amount that matters from a technical capabilities sense has decreased over time,\u201d he told NPR.  Then came the bad news: About a thousand of the NSA\u2019s intel targets are taking \u201csteps to remove themselves from our visibility,\u201d using Snowden\u2019s dangerously extensive disclosures about how that visibility worked. \u201cThere was a terrorist group that was actually engaged in operational planning directly against the United States and western Europe, that changed the way they communicated because of those disclosures.

It is a grim testimony to the level of terrorist activity that knowing the time frame does not help much when trying to guess which terror attack he is talking about. Snowden defenders usually claim that such vague assertions mean the intelligence community is lying or exaggerating to paint the defector in a more negative light. Snowden himself recently repeated his assertion that the NSA programs he exposed provide very little benefit to the war against terrorism. \u201cIt was diplomatic manipulation, economic spying and social control. It was about power, and there is no doubt that mass surveillance increases the power of the government,\u201d he said in an interview with Spanish television, as reported earlier this week by Russian propaganda outlet RT. com. In his NPR interview, Ledgett pronounced himself satisfied with the new programs implemented after the Snowden revelations, particularly the way private companies are now storing bulk communications data instead of the NSA, although he noted the new approach has been somewhat slower and more expensive thus far. He anticipated the speed concerns would be addressed by the new \u201cNSA 21\u201d reorganization plan, which would make the agency \u201cmore agile about how we prioritize, how we pivot from one topic to another. \u201d","short_description":"NSA lost track of 1,000 intelligence targets due to Snowden's revelations, including a terrorist group planning attacks.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Donald Trump Releases TV Ad Attacking Hillary Clinton on Pay-To-Play Politics - Breitbart","content":"The Trump campaign is running a national television ad going after Hillary Clinton and the alleged    scheme with the Clinton Foundation.

The same media that are pretending to consider the use of a bad word equivalent to rape don\u2019t give a fig about real rape, real sexual assault, real whoring, even real homicide, depending on who did it. JFK was an   drug addict who cavorted with whores at the White House, but the media ferociously hid all this from the public, publishing   versions of his presidency as \u201cCamelot. \u201d And what happened to the   rule? Trump said the word \u201cp*ssy\u201d 11 years ago, in a secretly recorded conversation. Eleven years before Sen. Teddy Kennedy ran for president, he killed a girl  \u2014   but he ran, not only without apology, but, indeed, as the Conscience of the Democratic Party. Throughout 2009, good, decent Americans who happened to oppose Obamacare were called the name of a gay sex act hundreds of times on TV  \u2014   and that was just on MSNBC. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper made the reference explicit when he giggled, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk when you\u2019re  . \u201d Among the people using this sexual slur were distinguished members of Congress such as U. S. Sen. Robert Menendez and Rep. Barney Frank. Were they fit to hold office? Going way, way, way back to a few weeks ago, the same media gasping in horror at \u201cp*ssy\u201d sure didn\u2019t mind my being called a c*nt repeatedly on a Comedy Central broadcast. And when I say \u201cdidn\u2019t mind,\u201d I mean they thought it was awesome. But saying \u201cp*ssy\u201d 11 years ago is over the line. Cut the crap, media. A few years ago, Sen. Al Franken joked on a Comedy Central roast about producer Rob Reiner  *cking his children. Does Hillary think he\u2019s fit to be a U. S. senator? Is he fit enough for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but not the Senate Finance Committee? None of these were leaks of secretly recorded conversations  \u2014   considered a hanging offense in the Clinton years. These vulgarities were intentionally, publicly broadcast by the same media that, today, pretend to need smelling salts after hearing \u201cp*ssy. \u201d At least this new puritanical standard explains why rappers like Jay Z are banned from the White House. Wait  \u2014   what? Perhaps realizing their Victorian virgin act wasn\u2019t cutting it, the media turned to their Pretend We Don\u2019t Understand English method of argument, and claimed that Trump was confessing to having committed a \u201csexual assault\u201d! Trump said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do any of that. (Laughter. )\u201d Journalists turned this into \u201csexual assault\u201d by being literal on the \u201cgrab\u201d part,   on the \u201cyou\u201d part  \u2014   and on the \u201cthey let you do it\u201d part? Stone, cold deaf. If \u201cthey let you do it,\u201d it\u2019s not an assault. Like most of Trump\u2019s bragging, his loutish boast was not intended to be taken seriously, nor was it. Far from whipping out his pencil and carefully taking notes, \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u2018s Billy Bush laughed. The gist of what Trump was saying is that  \u2014   hold onto your hats!  \u2014   women like to sleep with celebrities! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard that before. At least we\u2019re back to the media pretending to care about sexual assault  \u2014   until further notice. This is the same media that ran interference for an actual sexual predator in the White House, ignoring Bill Clinton\u2019s serial   groping and raping for nearly a decade, while gleefully vilifying his accusers, and would have been happy to continue if Bill Richardson had become president. Clinton talking about p*ssy was one of his more dignified moments, proudly attested to by his friend Vernon Jordan in a nationally broadcast interview with Mike Wallace. In the pages of The New York Times, feminist icon Gloria Steinem announced the \u201c  grope\u201d rule, specially developed for the Clinton era. Former Time magazine correspondent Nina Burleigh said of Clinton, \u201cI would be happy to give him a bl*w job just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. \u201d Time magazine\u2019s Margaret Carlson said Linda Tripp had \u201clost membership in the family of man\u201d for secretly   Monica Lewinsky. Tripp kept the recordings not for something so exalted as stopping Trump, but to protect herself from a charge of perjury. Even when the law began to close in on the horny hick  \u2014   midway through the second term he won because of the media\u2019s heroic    \u2014   the rest of us had to spend a year listening to liberals say \u201cGuys like bl*w jobs,\u201d \u201cEverybody does it\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s move on. \u201d When Clinton was credibly accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick, NBC strategically held the story  \u2014   until a week after the Senate had voted in the rapist\u2019s impeachment trial. All the public could do was helplessly sport \u201cFree Lisa Myers\u201d buttons, referring to the investigative reporter who got the interview. Explaining NBC\u2019s incomprehensible decision to hold its own investigative report, Myers told Broaddrick: \u201cThe good news is you\u2019re credible. The bad news is that you\u2019re very credible. \u201d At least NBC ran the story eventually. The name \u201cJuanita Broaddrick\u201d never crossed the lips of \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Dan Rather. Asked by FNC\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly why he never got around to mentioning that the commander in chief was, more likely than not, a rapist, Rather said, \u201cWhen the charge has something to do with somebody\u2019s private sex life, I would prefer not to run any of it. \u201d So according to our media, committing a rape is \u201csomebody\u2019s private sex life,\u201d but using a bad word is rape. Poor Billy Bush has to be fired from NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show so the media can pretend that Trump\u2019s using bawdy language is a very, very serious offense. Meanwhile, Billy\u2019s   uncle and cousin openly fraternize with the rapist.

He was a dean at a Boston public high school. He mentored young people. And, Harrison regularly attended services at a local church for a decade, before leaving in 2012, according to the church\u2019s pastor.  Now, Harrison is charged with armed assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He\u2019s also facing multiple weapons charges.   Harrison is accused of shooting one of his students in the head.  While he was working as \u201ddean of academy\u201d at English High, Harrison was also running a marijuana distribution enterprise, according to Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney, David Bradley.  At an arraignment hearing Thursday, Bradley said the      dean shot a    student he had allegedly hired to sell marijuana.  The teenager, who called Harrison \u201dRev\u201d told authorities he was regularly mentored by Harrison, according to police documents.  Bradley said in a news release that the two got into a dispute after leaving Harrison\u2019s home Tuesday evening.  They were walking along a street when Harrison then \u201dproduced a handgun, pointed it at the back of the victim\u2019s head and fired,\u201d Bradley said in a news release.   The incident was captured on surveillance footage, but the police have not released it.  The teen, who has not been named by police yet, was shot behind the right ear, according to a police report. He is expected to survive his injuries, Bradley\u2019s release said. Harrison had worked in various positions with the Boston Public Schools since 2010.  He had been \u201ddean of academy\u201d at English High School since January 5, where \u201dhe provided services, like finding housing for homeless students or social services or disciplinary alternatives to suspension,\u201d said Denise Snyder, a representative for Boston Public Schools.  His employment has been \u201dterminated effective immediately,\u201d Snyder said.  The Rev. Dr. Gregory Groover, pastor of the Charles Street AME Church where Harrison attended services said the allegations against Harrison aren\u2019t consistent with the man he knows.  \u201dI was stunned beyond description,\u201d Groover said when he heard about  Harrison\u2019s arrest.   Groover said Harrison was already an ordained Baptist minister when he came to the Charles Street AME Church.  He recalled Harrison usually attended services alone, but he \u201dgot along with everyone.\u201d   \u201dHe seemed to consistently care with a deep heart for saving young people who were in the streets or gang related, \u201d Groover said.  \u201dThat was the population that his life seemed to center around.\u201d  A not guilty plea was automatically entered on Harrison\u2019s behalf.  He posted $250, 000 bail and is  under house arrest, according to police documents.  He has been ordered to \u201dstay away and have no contact with the victim\u201d and wear a GPS monitor, the DA\u2019s release said. He is scheduled to be back in court on April 6.

It came courtesy of a model named Hirakish, who careened down the runway in a   suit and spiky   bootees, and who proceeded to go   and to spend the rest of the show running in and out of the stands, interrupting other models\u2019 struts and otherwise joyfully, and challengingly, sticking his   feet in our faces. I thought of this on Thursday when the news came that Prince Rogers Nelson, the diminutive musician with the oversize talent, had died. Unlike David Bowie, another musical icon who recently passed away, Prince was not often   by designers as a collection reference. Though fashion played a big part in his image, as the many slide shows making their way around cyberspace attest, and though he made a surprise guest appearance in 2007 at Matthew Williamson\u2019s 10th anniversary show, serenading the attendees and grinding with dancers and models (as one of the attendees, I can tell you, that was another \u201cmoment\u201d) he wasn\u2019t a   aesthetic inspiration. Prince refused to adhere to genres in clothing, just as he refused to adhere to genres in music, which meant he tended to ooze into the designer imagination, instead of immediately leaping to mind. But in the way he assumed the tropes of kitsch femininity  \u2014   lace, ruffles, sequins, peekaboo and high heels  \u2014   and transformed them into the vehicles of an    masculine sex appeal, Prince had enormous influence. Most of which can be summed up by the shoe. The high heel was the   of his wardrobe for the four decades he was in the public eye, the consistent base upon which he layered all sorts of style and character changes. Prince wore heels when he barely wore anything at all (just bikini bottoms and a trench coat) he wore them in \u201cPurple Rain\u201d and with baroque brocade he paired them with pastel suits,     jumpsuits he wore them with white hippie tunics at Coachella and slinky metallic gold at the Grammys he wore them offstage, out to dinner in Sweden in 2013, and, according to Mike Tyson\u2019s memoir, \u201cUndisputed Truth,\u201d to play basketball. He wore them so much that there were rumors he needed hip surgery. And he wore them, he said, not because he wanted to be taller, but because \u201cwomen like \u2019em. \u201d He wore them as they were originally designed to be worn, as demonstrated in \u201cStanding Tall,\u201d an exhibition last year at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto about men in high heels: as an expression of power and privilege reserved for male royalty, and only later   by women in the 17th and 18th centuries. It made some sense. His name, after all, was Prince. And in doing so  \u2014   in wearing them so regularly, unapologetically (he did not hide behind the acceptably masculine heels of cowboy boots) and effectively  \u2014   he transformed the idea of men in heels to possibility from joke. On women, heels suggest sex Prince showed they could function the same way for men. It is a meaningful part of the equation that has added up to the current trend toward gender fluidity in fashion. Which, let\u2019s face it, really means men in women\u2019s wear, since women have been borrowing from men\u2019s wear for decades. Put another way: There was Prince, and then there was Hedi Slimane\u2019s fall 2015 men\u2019s wear show for Saint Laurent, with its   heels the heels in the men\u2019s wear collections of Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh (and Hood by Air) and the black velvet midcalf heeled boots Kanye West wore in Paris last year, to name just some examples. In the end, his shoes were, as Prince once sang, a sign o\u2019 the times.","short_description":"Prince's influence on fashion, particularly in challenging gender norms, is highlighted through his iconic use of high heels.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"\u2019American Sniper,\u2019 the Oscars and that fake baby","content":" (CNN) Get ready for the conspiracy theories if \u201dAmerican Sniper\u201d doesn\u2019t snag the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday.

[The     promise was delivered, half buried, in a \u201cTown Hall\u201d meeting conducted with Paul Ryan by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.  \u201cWe need to have an immigration system that is wired for what our economy needs   \u2026     so let\u2019s find out where those gaps in our labor markets are and have our immigration system wired for that,\u201d Ryan said.  By offering foreign workers to fill   \u201cgaps\u201d in the labor market, Ryan would give employers a huge gift  \u2014   the ability to hire foreign workers whenever American employees or young   ask for higher wages, and without ever having to train any Americans to take     jobs. That\u2019s a huge giveaway to employers and to Wall Street, where stock prices rise when wages drop. Ryan\u2019s   promise was ignored by CNN and other media outlets.  The scale of the Ryan giveaway can be measured against the final years of President Bill Clinton\u2019s term, when employers had to offer higher wages to prevent their workers from being lured away by other employers. Wages nudged up briefly during the   bubble, but have largely stalled ever since.  Workers haven\u2019t gained wage increases from marketplace pressure since the late 1990s, partly because the federal government imports roughly one new legal or illegal foreign worker for every three Americans who join the labor market each year. Roughly 4 million Americans turn 18 each year and compete for jobs against roughly 1 million new legal immigrants, plus several hundred thousand new illegals, plus 700, 000 new   and   temporary guest workers.  In his town hall meeting, Ryan said he opposed Trump\u2019s plans to repatriate the roughly 11 million illegal migrants, and then said he would favor some form of staged amnesty for the illegals. \u201cThose [illegal immigrant] people who need to get right with the law   \u2026     so that they can get a work permit, a work permit to work,\u201d Paul Ryan said.  \u201cThat to me is more of an approach that works, it makes sense, and it will  \u2014   it won\u2019t require a roundup or mass deportation, which I just don\u2019t think is a good idea,\u201d said Ryan, who is strongly backed by U. S. business groups. The population of at least 11 million illegal migrants includes at least 8 million workers who compete for jobs with Americans and who drive down wages. Ryan has consistently pushed this \u201cany willing worker\u201d message for years. For example, he told National Journal magazine in 2013 that migrants,   \u2026     bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done. The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce their products, which are mostly cheese. If they can\u2019t find workers, then they can\u2019t produce   \u2026     The flip side of the argument is: Just raise wages enough to attract people. But you raise wages too much in certain industries, then you\u2019ll get rid of those industries, and we\u2019ll just have to import. NJ Should   and   workers be treated the same? RYAN: They should have different visa categories that should fluctuate with the needs of the economy. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to negotiate here. Most other countries have a visa system that is wired to feed their economy. Unsurprisingly, Wall Street studies have shown that   immigration reduces wages, and that actual enforcement of the laws against illegal immigrants forces employers to pay higher wages to Americans. Last month, a Wall Street study showed that Donald Trump\u2019s   and immigration plans would force up wages and also reduce the price of housing. In 2013, a report by the Congressional Budget Office showed that   migration shifts wealth away from workers and towards Wall Street. The   process applies to both   workers and to skilled   workers. For example, many Americans who want their kids to get a good job at one of the nation\u2019s universities don\u2019t know that the universities already have hired roughly 100, 000 foreign   guest workers, each of whom rationally accepts lower wages for the opportunity to work in the United States instead of China or India. Ryan has personally expanded this job outsourcing process. In December 2015, for example, he added language to the annual funding bill that allows companies to bring in an additional 190, 000 temporary   workers each year, at wages set by employers, not by the routine   tension between supply and demand, workers and employers. Unfortunately for Ryan, Americans in the Midwest are the most concerned over the impact of   immigration on their wages and jobs. For example, a recent poll asked respondents, \u201cIn general, do you think immigrants in the United States help create jobs, take away jobs, or have no impact on jobs?\u201d   percent of Midwestern respondents picked the \u201ctake away jobs\u201d answer, while only 16 percent picked \u201ccreate jobs. \u201d The   gap  \u2014   almost a consensus  \u2014   was much wider than the other regions. Also, an unusually large slice of respondents  \u2014   30 percent  \u2014   said migrants have no impact, or declared they did not know the impact, suggesting that some people did not want to reveal their preference for less immigration.  Surprisingly, Jake Tapper did not press Paul Ryan to explain how Americans\u2019 salaries and wages would be impacted by the \u201cany willing worker\u201d visa system. Instead, he allowed Ryan to talk about how the border should be secured. Ryan said he wants the border secured against drug smugglers and terrorists  \u2014   but mostly to ensure that Americans will accept the \u201cany willing worker\u201d   plan.  You have to secure the border. You have to secure the border for many reasons. Enforcing the rule of law, guarding against heroin coming to the border, ISIS from trying to infiltrate our country, and you have to secure the border also so that the public believes that the rule of law is being applied in this country so that they have faith that our government\u2019s actually doing its basic responsibility in keeping the country secure.  Then I believe you need to fix this broken immigration system. So once you get this border secured, you\u2019ve got to fix a broken legal immigration system, which isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s 20th century. We need to bring it to the 21st century. Others journalists recognize the huge political gulf between Ryan and Trump on wages and labor.

Instead, for Ryan, immigration is just a way for employers to import foreign workers and to trump the market for labor whenever Americans ask for the higher wages which they\u2019ve fairly earned in the job market  \u2014   and which they need to help them get married, buy a house and raise more than one child.  \u201cI think we should give visas based on what the economy needs so that we\u2019re making sure that [illegal immigrant] people aren\u2019t taking jobs that Americans can take, that Americans can fill   \u2026    then after we do that   \u2026     we\u2019re still going to need [more foreign] people in this country,\u201d he said.

The office of Prime Minister Theresa May poured cold water on the memo, denying reports that it was prepared for the government. \u201cThis unsolicited document has nothing to do with the government at all,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIt was produced by an individual from an external accountancy firm. It has no authority, and we don\u2019t recognize any of the claims it makes. \u201d Chris Grayling, secretary of state for transport, told BBC Radio on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a government report. \u201d As for Britain\u2019s departure from the union, known as Brexit, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a complex process, albeit with some simple objectives. \u201d The British press, already fluttery over the complications of leaving the European Union and the uncertainties of a trade deal with a President Donald J. Trump who, as a candidate, expressed opposition to free trade, seized on the memo, which The Times said was drafted on Nov. 7 by a \u201cconsultant\u201d working for the Cabinet Office, a government department that supports the prime minister. According to The Guardian, the memo was \u201cunderstood\u201d to have been written by a consultant at Deloitte and was unsolicited by the government. \u201cThis was a note intended primarily for internal audiences,\u201d said Mark Smith, a spokesman for Deloitte, confirming the Guardian report. \u201cIt was not commissioned by the Cabinet Office, nor any other government department, and represents a view of the task facing Whitehall,\u201d he added, referring to the central government administration. \u201cThis work was conducted without access to No. 10 or input from any other government departments. \u201d But the memo to a large extent said what is widely understood: The government has not yet finished its internal debate on what kind of relationship it wants with the European Union, nor has it set its priorities for any negotiation and the cabinet remains divided between those favoring as clean a break with Brussels as possible and those who want to preserve   access to the huge European market. That negotiation would not begin in any case until Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets a   limit for talks with the other 27 member states about Britain\u2019s exit. A ruling by the High Court, which is being appealed by the government, said Parliament must have a debate and vote on invoking Article 50, which is not solely in the jurisdiction of the British cabinet. While the memo spoke of six months before the government could agree on a negotiating strategy, Mrs. May has said she intends to invoke the article by the end of March. She has said little specifically about what she favors, other than a deal that allows immigration controls as well as access to the European single market, which many European officials regard, at least for now, as incompatible. For now, as the memo suggested, she is trying to keep her Conservative Party together to avoid early elections. The memo also pointed to Britain\u2019s   need for more trade negotiators and lawyers to work through that future relationship. Having been a member of the European Union for more than 40 years, Britain had no need for trade negotiators and clearly needs to hire more, and quickly any deal will be legally intricate. Given budget cuts and computerization, today\u2019s Civil Service is reported to be the smallest since World War II, at 400, 000. The memo\u2019s figure of 30, 000 extra civil servants seemed high, however, given that the entire staff of the European Commission  \u2014   Brussels\u2019 supposedly mighty bureaucracy  \u2014   is 33, 000, according to official figures. David Archer, who is recruiting lawyers and trade negotiators to suggest to the government, said 10 percent of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s he is now receiving are of \u201cgood quality,\u201d with required experience. The number of civil servants is down 20 percent since 2010, Mr. Archer said, and many civil servants are unhappy with Brexit. \u201cMorale is awful and rock bottom,\u201d he said. Mr. Archer, director of the executive search firm Circle Square, said that the government was training civil servants internally, and looking to law firms, former ambassadors and former trade negotiators. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, since we haven\u2019t negotiated at an international level since 1973,\u201d he said. There are about 600 trade negotiators worldwide, Mr. Archer said, including 40 currently in London. Robert Bourns, the president of the Law Society, said the government was doing its best at recruiting for Brexit, but with only a few months before Article 50 is invoked, \u201cthis is an enormous task. \u201d Much of current British law has been developed in Europe, Mr. Bourns said. He added that the government recognized that the number of lawyers capable of drafting legislation had been reduced over time, and needed to be increased. Mr. Grayling, a prominent Brexit supporter, said the government has \u201cpeople in my department and in other departments working with the Brexit department,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know what 30, 000 extra people would do. \u201d According to the memo, various government departments are working on more than 500 projects related to Brexit, which is more than they can handle. It also repeated widespread reporting about Mrs. May\u2019s management style, which is secretive. It said her tendency of \u201cdrawing in decisions and details to settle matters herself\u201d or with a small circle of aides would prove unsustainable. \u201cIt may be six months before there is a view on   strategy as the political situation in the U. K. and the E. U. evolves,\u201d said the document, titled \u201cBrexit Update. \u201d Members of Parliament who favor a quick Brexit attacked the memo as intended to harm their case. John Redwood, a prominent Conservative who supports Brexit, said: \u201cIt\u2019s complete nonsense. You don\u2019t need consultants who are against Brexit and trying to undermine it. They are not speaking for the government, and I\u2019m very glad they are not. Brexit can be much quicker, better and cheaper than they think. \u201d Another   legislator, Steve Baker, said: \u201cThis gloomy memo carries all the hallmarks of the campaign we know is in progress to defy the will of the British people. \u201d","short_description":"Leaked memo suggests UK government may need six more months and 30,000 civil servants to handle Brexit negotiations.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"The Olympics are having an unprecedented meltdown","content":"\u2019\u2019 \u2019LONDON (AP)  \u2014   Doping scandals.

The Sochi Olympics, one of Putin\u2019\u2019s pet projects, could wind up as Russia\u2019\u2019s Shame Games.\u2019 \u201dThe new doping allegations won\u2019t help Russia\u2019s case for having its track and field athletes reinstated for the Rio Games. They were suspended by the IAAF following a WADA panel report that found   cheating. Pressure also mounted on Kenya  \u2014   and its celebrated distance runners  \u2014   when the East African nation was declared   Thursday with WADA\u2019s rules.\u201d \u201dNever has a host nation been in such political and economic turmoil before an Olympics. Seven years ago, when the IOC picked Rio de Janeiro to host South America\u2019s first Olympics, Brazil was a rising star on the world stage with a booming, emerging economy. Now, 84 days before the games begin, the country is in its worst recession since the 1930s. It is torn by a massive corruption scandal centered on oil giant Petrobras. Olympic budgets have been slashed.\u201d \u201dThe political situation has imploded  \u2014   with the Senate voting Thursday to impeach President Dilma Rousseff. She\u2019s now suspended and won\u2019t be declaring the Olympics open on Aug. 5. Her vice president, Michel Temer, is now the interim president.\u201d \u2019\u2019 \u2019While most of the Olympic venues are ready, concerns remain over the severe water pollution at the sailing and rowing sites.\u2019 \u201dIf all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Brazil is in the grip of the Zika virus. The   disease has been proven to cause a range of severe birth defects, including   babies born with abnormally small heads and a rare neurological disorder that can cause temporary paralysis. A Canadian professor said this week the Olympics should be postponed or moved because of the Zika threat. The IOC and World Health Organization said the games will be safe, while urging visitors to take precautions.\u201d \u2019Most Olympics are preceded by controversies and   worries, only for the mood to lift once the cauldron has been lit and the host country has won its first medal. Perhaps that will be the case once the first TV pictures show the Olympic flame burning against a backdrop of the Copacabana beach, Sugar Loaf mountain and the Christ the Redeemer statue.\u2019 \u2019The first Winter Olympics in South Korea have been dogged by more problems than expected, including construction delays, conflicts over venues, a shortage of local sponsors  \u2014   and a   leadership. While preparations for the 2018 games seemed to accelerate after successful test events this winter, the local organizing committee was hit by yet another sudden resignation of its top leader. For the second time in less than two years, there has been a change at the helm.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 \u2019Business tycoon Cho   stepped down to focus on dealing with the financial troubles at the shipping company his family controls. Cho had taken over in July 2014 after the sudden resignation of Kim   the former governor of the Pyeongchang region. On Thursday, Pyeongchang elected former South Korean government minister Lee   a newcomer to the sports world, as the new organizing committee chief. With less than two years to go until the games, Lee will need to get up to speed  \u2014   fast.\u2019 \u2019Tokyo, seen as a safe choice when awarded the games three years ago, has been buffeted by a series of problems. The original stadium design was scrapped because it was too expensive. The original logo was dumped after allegations it was copied from a Belgian theater.\u2019 \u201dBut this week brought the most damaging setback yet: allegations of possible bribery during Tokyo\u2019s winning bid.\u201d \u2019French prosecutors, who have been investigating IAAF corruption, said Thursday they had widened their inquiry to look into payments of 2. 8 million Singapore dollars ($2 million) from a bank in Japan to an account in Singapore in the months before and after Tokyo won the games.\u2019 \u2019The account in Singapore was tied to the son of disgraced former IAAF President Lamine Diack. Both Diacks are under investigation in France on corruption charges.\u2019","short_description":"The Olympics face a wave of scandals, including doping, bribery, economic crises, and the Zika virus threat.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Taiwan Deploys Warship to South China Sea: Hague Ruling \u2019Seriously Hurt Our Rights\u2019","content":"President Tsai   of Taiwan personally sent off a naval warship Wednesday morning to patrol Taiping Island, a Taiwanese territory in the South China Sea that Taipei fears they could lose as a result of Tuesday\u2019s verdict rejecting China\u2019s claims to most of the South China Sea. [\u201cThe South China arbitration ruling, especially in the part about Taiping Island, has seriously hurt our rights to the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters,\u201d Tsai said in a statement aboard the ship, wishing them well on their mission to \u201cdefend Taiwan\u2019s territory. \u201d She added, \u201cYour patrol mission to the South China Sea, which is being conducted ahead of schedule, is highly significant in view of the new development. \u201d  \u201cWe will never accept it (the tribunal\u2019s ruling).   \u2026     It is not legally binding,\u201d Taiwanese presidential office spokesman Alex Huang said Tuesday. \u201cWe will definitely defend our territorial sovereignty and not allow our   \u2026     interests be harmed. \u201d He added a complaint that The Hague \u201cnever sought out advice\u201d and rejected attempts by the Taiwanese government to participate in the ruling. Taiwan\u2019s position in the South China Sea dispute is more precarious than the other parties involved because China does not recognize it as a country. Instead, Beijing usurps all Taiwanese claims as its own. Thus, it is vocally supporting Taiwan\u2019s moves to assert its sovereignty over Taiping Island, claiming that it is doing so on behalf of Beijing, not Taipei. The government of Tsai   has been clear that its claims to Taiping are not in China\u2019s name, and any attempts by Beijing to usurp Taiwanese territory in the form of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the region will be rejected. Tsai\u2019s rejection of China\u2019s claims to Taiwanese territory are a departure from the policy of her predecessor, Ma   who visited Taiping to assert Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, leading to Beijing\u2019s praising his move as an intended show of support for China. Ma invited    Tsai to accompany him, but she refused. China is, nonetheless, praising Tsai\u2019s decision to send a warship to the region. \u201cWe are willing to join other countries in promoting peace and stability in the South China Sea under a [sic] equal footing,\u201d China\u2019s   Minister Liu Zhenmin said in support of Taiwan\u2019s claims Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post.","short_description":"Taiwan sends warship to patrol disputed island in South China Sea after rejecting China's claims.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Clinton campaign blasts FBI Director Comey: \u2019There\u2019s no reason he had to send this letter\u2019","content":"\u2019  \u2019 \u201d   Hillary Clinton and some of her campaign\u2019s top   officials blasted FBI Director James Comey on Saturday   afternoon over his decision to  that the   bureau had reopened its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private   email server. \u201d \u2019   In a conference call with reporters, campaign chairman John   Podesta called the reaction to Comey\u2019\u2019s announcement \u201doverblown,\u201d   and campaign manager Robby Mook said Comey\u2019\u2019s decision to send the   letter was \u201dcompletely unfair\u201d to Clinton and to voters. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dIt\u2019\u2019s completely unfair to Sec.

The decisions that directly affect the satisfaction of airline customers originate from offices outside the airplane. As pilots, most times we resign ourselves to the fact that we must trust the other offices to make appropriate decisions. On some days, well . .. we raise our eyebrows. When the  International Air Transport Association recommended a reduction in   bag dimensions last week, it was one of those times.  I get the logic. When the airlines first became slaves to the almighty Department of Transportation\u2019s documentation of   arrivals and departures in January 1995, it became important to be the carrier with the best record between New York and Chicago, between Washington and Boston    between wherever. At first, it was a, \u201dDamn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\u201d attitude.  Airplanes were being pushed back from the gate with passengers standing in the aisles while flight attendants scampered about helping to shove overstuffed   into overstuffed overhead bins. The Federal Aviation Administration wasn\u2019t pleased, and in response began to strictly enforce the regulation that required all   bags be stowed before closing the entry doors. The adjustment period was difficult. Invariably, when ground personnel had the airplane all closed up and ready to go at the gate, I would get an intercom call from the flight attendants with the standard script of, \u201dCaptain, we still have passengers standing in the aisle.\u201d Our cabin crew would then make frantic efforts to help wrestle bags into overhead bins. An   departure was the Holy Grail. Although the cabin crews have adjusted to the routine, it can still be a difficult process. Revenue generation aside, airline management has helped to create the problem by charging to check bags. Who wouldn\u2019t want to stuff a little extra into their   to save on the cost of an   bag? Storage space can become a premium on crowded flights. But as opponents to the   IATA proposal have said, we shouldn\u2019t penalize our customers further by forcing them to shrink their   and pay for extra luggage for a problem the airline generated. With the proposal shot down, what is the solution, then?  Well, a     airplane goes a long way in mitigating the problem. Unfortunately, a     aircraft is not conducive to efficient movement. The typical instruction the flight attendants give to step out of the aisle and let other people pass behind does not necessarily allow for rapid storage of items in the overhead bins. Some airlines have given   priority to passengers without   bags. Others have begun trials with a   process where airline personnel store your   above your seat in an overhead bin before boarding. And if your bag doesn\u2019t fit and you\u2019re at the   of the boarding process, it just has to be checked to your destination. Sorry.  Certainly, greater minds than mine can come up with more innovative solutions. And by the way, I measured my   bag. The bag is designed specifically for airline crewmembers. It\u2019s 1 inch over the length limit, 1 inch over the width limit and a good 3 inches over the depth limit of the IATA recommendation.   As a   airline veteran, I\u2019ll proclaim myself a traveling professional. Granted, if I\u2019m flying the trip, my   have a designated spot either in the cockpit or the cabin. But other times, I am on equal footing with passengers, making me just as invested in what airline management chooses to do next in regard to   luggage. I\u2019d rather not see my passengers opt for Amtrak, or worse, their own automobiles. Please, let\u2019s find a better solution to the   bag conundrum.

The correct pronunciation of the city is \u201dcan.\u201d Since 1995, the \u201dnumber of feature films shown at March\u00e9 du Film has more than doubled.\u201d The March\u00e9 du Film is a parallel portion of the film festival that is a meeting place for film professionals to view, buy and sell films from around the world. The Festival lasts for approximately two weeks. The top award at the festival is the Palme d\u2019Or, the prize for best film. It was first presented in 1955, replacing another \u201dGrand Prix\u201d prize. The top award for a first film is the Camera d\u2019Or, presented by an independent jury. It was first presented in 1978. The festival is divided into five sections: 1.  In Competition   films up for the Palme d\u2019Or.  2.  Out of Competition   films not competing for the top prize, but there for the publicity. 3.  Un Certain Regard   usually challenging art films that aren\u2019t quite up to competing in the mainstream. 4.  Cin\u00e9fondation   works done by film students. 5.

[\u201cIn a movement like Black Lives Matter, there\u2019s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid, or imprudent, or overgeneralized, or harsh,\u201d Obama told reporters at a Sunday press conference, just three days after an     racist murdered five police officers who were guarding a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.   \u201cEverybody involved in the Black Lives Matter movement   \u2026     I want all of them to maintain a respectful, thoughtful tone  \u2014   because, as a practical matter, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to get change done,\u201d Obama said.  The shocking attack in Dallas has wrecked the political momentum gained by the   movement when stressed police killed two   suspects during that first week of July, in Minnesota and Louisiana. Immediately after those shootings, Obama had sought to use the two shootings to push his campaign to get more federal regulatory control over state and local police forces. But because his campaign has been accompanied by a growing number of riots and of attacks on police, including in Dallas, Obama is being forced to defend and calm his angry allies, amid growing criticism that his   rhetoric has ignored a nationwide,   \u201cWar on Cops. \u201d So far this year, 26 police have been killed in shootings, marking a 63 percent increase over 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. After the Dallas shooting, gunman shot at three more policemen in Tennessee, Missouri, and Georgia. On Sunday, in Missouri, an   man was shot and killed as he broke into a police officers\u2019 home following an argument on Facebook. The anger among Obama\u2019s allies was recorded July 9, when a BLM activist in St. Paul, Minn. frantically berated a TV reporter, while others shouted \u2018Get Out of Here,\u2019 and urged each other to attack him. \u201cHe is the face of white supremacy,\u201d the activist shouted. FOX reporter asks the \u201dpeaceful protesters\u201d why they are blocking a roadway: https:  .   \u2014   Alison Arkin (@Cronikeys) July 11, 2016,  The video can be viewed here. The     movement also put rioters on the streets of several cities over the weekend. In 2014 and 2015,   rioters wrecked the town of Ferguson, Mo. and damaged the center of Baltimore. For the moment, Obama and his deputies are simply pretending that the Dallas attack had nothing to do the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the killer\u2019s decision to explain his     motives to Dallas police. \u201cThe shooter is not reflective of the large movement to bring about change that was out in Dallas to peacefully demonstrate,\u201d Jeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s loyal head of the the Department of Homeland Security, told a CBS interviewer on Sunday. But the growing wave of attacks on cops has put Obama on the political defense, and his supporters may spin further out of control to create more riots or attack that would delegitimize his campaign to federalize state and local police forces  \u2014   and also damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s election chances. \u201cI would just say to everybody who\u2019s concerned about the issue of police shootings or racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful and serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change. And that is our ultimate objective,\u201d he said at the Sunday press conference.  Obama did briefly condemn attacks on police, but spent much of the Sunday press conference repeatedly telling his   allies that angry rhetoric against police is counterproductive to his political goals.  Any violence directed at police officers is a reprehensible crime and needs to be prosecuted.  But even rhetorically, if we paint police in broad brush, without recognizing that the vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people and do so fairly and without racial bias, if our rhetoric does not recognize that, then we\u2019re going to lose allies in the reform cause. Yet Obama simultaneously raised the political temperature by portraying the   movement as similar to the prior   political groups, some of which have include violent campaigns, such as the attacks launched by the terrorist groups, such as the Black Panthers, the Weathermen and violence by union members. Obama even cited the abolitionist movement, whose work was completed by the very bloody U. S. Civil War.  One of the great things about America is that individual citizens and groups of citizens can petition their government, can protest, can speak truth to power.  And that is sometimes messy and controversial.  But because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech, America, over time, has gotten better.  We\u2019ve all benefited from that.  The abolition movement was contentious.  The effort for women to get the right to vote was contentious and messy.  There were times when activists might have engaged in rhetoric that was overheated and occasionally counterproductive.  But the point was to raise issues so that we, as a society, could grapple with it.  The same was true with the Civil Rights Movement, the union movement, the environmental movement, the   movement during Vietnam.  And I think what you\u2019re seeing now is part of that longstanding tradition. Obama also said that the \u201cflip side\u201d of   by his allies is for the cops to admit they\u2019re in the wrong.  The flip side of that   \u2026      would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustration that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests and these complaints as political correctness, or as politics or attacks on police.  There are legitimate issues that have been raised, and there\u2019s data and evidence to back up the concerns that are being expressed by these protesters.  \u201cIf police organizations and departments acknowledge that there\u2019s a problem and there\u2019s an issue, then that, too, is going to contribute to real solutions,\u201d he said, without describing what would happen if police organizations do not submit to his political demands.

[The terms of the settlement with former   administrator Nicole Eramo are undisclosed but was deemed \u201camicable\u201d by the magazine. The agreement brings an end to the lawsuit that brought turmoil to the school and raised serious questions about journalistic ethics, the Washington Post reports.  \u201cWe are delighted that this dispute is now behind us, as it allows Nicole to move on and focus on doing what she does best, which is supporting victims of sexual assault,\u201d the victorious administrator\u2019s lawyer said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed after the 2014 story entitled \u201cA Rape on Campus,\u201d began to unravel. The story claimed to chronicle a history of sexual assaults at a university fraternity house but was later proved to be based on lies. For months, the story was hailed as a tour de force for social justice and an expose of   \u201crape culture,\u201d but it was not long before the claims of the central witness, named \u201cJackie,\u201d were discredited. The whole story was a fiction invented by Jackie and Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the writer for the Rolling Stone. In 2015,  \u2019s Nicole Eramo had filed a defamation suit against the music magazine for its failed story. By October 2016, Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner officially apologized to Eramo for publishing the false story. In her suit, Eramo claimed she faced personal threats, lost professional credibility, and lost her capacity to work as an advocate for   prevention.

The Senate is expected to take the first step by Thursday morning, approving parliamentary language in a budget resolution that would   a repeal bill that could not be filibustered in the Senate. House and Senate committees would have until Jan. 27 to report out repeal legislation. Health insurance and health care for millions of Americans are at risk. But far from reflecting the magnitude of the moment, the most prominent message from lobbyists that lawmakers saw in their first week back at work was a narrowly focused advertisement from the U. S. Chamber of Commerce demanding the repeal of \u201cObamacare taxes,\u201d especially an annual fee imposed on health insurance companies to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the health law. \u201cMore than 20 million people could lose their health insurance, and states could lose billions of dollars in Medicaid money,\u201d said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. But, he added, many health care executives \u201cdon\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of the new administration or the Republican majority in Congress. \u201d Health care professionals are not totally silent, but industries that were integral to the creation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 are keeping their voices down as Republicans rush to dismantle it. Some Republican lawmakers are openly fretting about their leaders\u2019 repeal strategy, saying they must develop an Affordable Care Act replacement before they repeal it. Five Republican senators proposed on Monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks, until March 3. One of the five, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the extra time would allow Congress and the Trump administration to \u201cget the policy right\u201d as they try to arrange a smooth transition to a new system of health coverage. But the naysayers are getting no cover from a major lobbying and advertisement blitz like the ones that blanketed the airwaves in 2009 and 2010. To block the repeal effort, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, \u201cwe need two or three Republicans to join us. \u201d Doctors are telling Congress to proceed with caution, insisting that no one should lose coverage. The American College of Physicians, representing 148, 000 specialists in internal medicine, has sent letters to senators urging them to \u201cvote no\u201d this week on the budget resolution. Hospitals were expecting to receive tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for treating people who were newly insured under the health law, and they are alarmed at the prospect that it may now be repealed. But, they say, if Congress goes ahead and rolls back the expansion of coverage, it must also restore tens of billions of dollars that the health law cut from Medicare payments to hospitals. Top executives from state hospital associations will fly to Washington this week to develop their strategy. Many also plan to visit offices on Capitol Hill, where they will warn of the potential damage if Congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it. A coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than $2 million on television advertisements urging Congress to stop its attack on the law. The ads, by the Alliance for Healthcare Security, are aimed at a handful of Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lamar Alexander and Mr. Corker of Tennessee, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. But by Washington standards, that is a pittance. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobbying group, set aside $150 million in 2009 to support the law\u2019s passage. Some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed, setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement. They fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law, they will lose their seats at the table as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration negotiate a replacement. For now, passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely. The real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now, when two House committees and two Senate committees produce legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and must answer to Republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time. At least a   Republican senators have expressed doubts about the Republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to   legislation to repeal the law, with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future. \u201cRepeal and replacement should take place simultaneously,\u201d Mr. Corker said last week. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, \u201cIt would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward. \u201d Members of the   House Freedom Caucus are also pressing leaders to embrace a replacement bill before they eviscerate the existing law. And that concern is not confined to Congress. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, has also warned Congress against repealing the law without a replacement. What, he has asked, will happen to the 700, 000 people who have gained coverage under the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio? Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said that he spoke on Friday with   Donald J. Trump, and that Mr. Trump agreed a replacement measure must be ready. \u201cI think he consistently has said, and I think many people who look at this say, \u2018Gosh, you\u2019re going to repeal this huge, dramatic thing and not have a replacement on the same day? \u2019\u201d Mr. Paul said on Monday. \u201cI mean, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to do that. \u201d Many of the lobbyists who might have slowed the process appear flummoxed, in part because they were expecting Hillary Clinton to win the election. Some companies, anxious about changes in health policy, said they were afraid to speak out because they feared that Mr. Trump would attack them on Twitter, as he has badgered Boeing, Ford, General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Toyota. Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of the leading lobby for insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, is in a particularly awkward position. As an Obama administration official from 2010 to 2015, she led work on the health law, issued rules to carry it out and often defended it on Capitol Hill. In December 2015, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin pointed to her as an example of how federal officials passed through a revolving door to work for companies they once regulated. \u201cIf the insurance industry does not understand how Obamacare works, why not hire the person who ran it?\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a gibe at Ms. Tavenner that drew laughter from his audience at the Library of Congress. Ms. Tavenner said the requirement for people to have insurance  \u2014   the individual mandate  \u2014   was likely to be eliminated. But, she said, to stabilize the market, Congress should maintain \u201csubsidies for   and   individuals to purchase insurance and financial help for plans that enroll   individuals, through at least Jan. 1, 2019. \u201d She is also asking Congress to kill the tax on insurers, which has already been suspended for 2017. Kaiser Permanente, the managed care company that serves more than 10 million people, declined to comment specifically on Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it offered a statement of general principles saying that people should have access to health care and that \u201cwe must continue to accommodate those who have   conditions. \u201d George C. Halvorson, a former chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, said insurers were guarded in their comments because the current environment was \u201cextremely politicized. \u201d He predicted they have more to say when Congress turns to the task of devising a replacement for the law. \u201cYou need to make your point when it will have optimal impact,\u201d Mr. Halvorson said. Lobbyists for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association have been more active and outspoken. They support changes to the health care law because, they say, premiums and deductibles are too high and commercial insurers have been dropping out of the public insurance marketplaces.   of counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage in the marketplace, they say, and in many cases, it is a Blue Cross plan. But Blue Cross lobbyists expressed alarm that Congress or a federal court might eliminate the   subsidies that the government pays insurers to reduce    costs for   people. Without these payments, Blue Cross wrote in a primer delivered to congressional offices, consumers will see \u201csignificant premium increases in 2018, making coverage even more unaffordable for millions of working Americans. \u201d While defenders of the Affordable Care Act try to figure out a strategy, conservative groups are pressing hard for full repeal of the law as soon as possible. Among them are Heritage Action for America, an offshoot of the Heritage Foundation, and Freedom Partners, a conservative group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.","short_description":"Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have left health industry lobbyists in disarray and millions at risk.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Obama\u2019s last trip will be to a divided Europe","content":" (CNN) On his final state tour as President of the United States, Barack Obama visited the Acropolis, the ancient Greek monument known as the \u201dcradle of democracy\u201d.  The white pillars of the Parthenon, which sits at the top of the Acropolis, still stand strong 2, 500 years on   a symbolic testament to the enduring idea of a government by and for the people. In the words of the Athenian general Pericles, \u201da government in the hands of the many, not the few.\u201d This time, President Obama comes to Europe as the defeated champion of two causes lost to democratic votes: opposition both to the election of Donald Trump as President and \u201dBrexit,\u201d  the British vote to leave the European Union.   For both the US and the EU, these are uncharted waters: how will   Trump    the only candidate in US history to have won without any experience in government, the law or the military     deal with Europe, but especially the European Union? Perhaps nothing spoke to EU fears more clearly than the photograph tweeted by Brexit champion and leader of the UK\u2019s   UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage, grinning inside a golden Trump Tower elevator, getting a thumbs up from the   himself.   Odds recalculated  Europe is fracturing Trump\u2019s victory has only widened the cracks further.   Consider this: France faces a Presidential election in a little more than six months and British betting agency, William Hill, has already recalculated the odds of the   candidate Marine Le Pen (once a distant   and the butt of political jokes) becoming the French President: jumping from   to a much more likely  .  Inspired by Brexit and Trump, Le Pen has made it clear she would hold a referendum to take France out of the EU. \u201dThere is absolutely no reason why the European Union should continue moving forward in this totalitarian way    at some time we have to stop and ask the question to the people of the various European countries: Do you still agree with all this? Do you agree with what the EU has become?\u201d she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr in an interview over the weekend.  \u201dI am absolutely convinced that if we did ask the question through a referendum in each country, the elites would be in for another surprise!\u201d And that\u2019s just in France.  The Netherlands has Geert Wilders, with his own   mane of silver hair and persistent calls for banning Islam from the country. Germany has Frauke Petry, a   young female politician whose key demand is to \u201dstop immigration altogether.\u201d All three are nationalist,   politicians who had seen a surge in the polls even before Trump boosted their odds.   As if the internal populist revolts were not enough, the EU is also seeing fault lines widening north to south on debt issues and east to west on refugees and immigration. A Europe united by \u2019 \u2019 identities, Greece and Italy remain deep in debt with no discernible way out, even as the EU\u2019s economic giant in the north, Germany, tightens the austerity screws.  In the east, the   Visegrad Group of nations    Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic    have formed a strong block against resettling refugees and increased migration, to the weak protests of Germany and France in the west.    Hungary\u2019s President, Viktor Orban, envisions a Europe united by \u201d \u201d identities, not a common set of liberal European values, as he told the Telegraph newspaper in Britain: \u201dIf we want to survive, this is the only way. To base our future on   identity. Otherwise we have no chance of surviving as Europe. We are not Europeans because we have \u2019common European values,\u2019 this is a misunderstanding.\u201d  He said, \u201dWe have to respect the fact that the people would like to have the feeling of that they control their own lives, and that there is no such thing as a \u2019European nation.\u2019 We have French, we have Germans, we have Hungarians but there are no European people. So the legitimacy, the democracy can come only from the nations, nowhere else. So if someone wants to build a European architecture over the European people, that\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a house built on sand, not on rock.\u201d How will Obama address a divided Europe? This is the divided Europe that President Obama now seeks to address. He will spoke to the Greek people in Athens on Wednesday, focusing on the challenges of globalization and the interdependence of global markets.  He will also meet with the leaders of Italy, France, Germany and the UK on Friday, in what was supposed to be a farewell state visit, but what is looking increasingly like an emergency briefing on the incoming presidency.   Perhaps his most poignant meeting will be his    with German Chancellor Angela Merkel    the foreign leader he has come to work so closely with.  As Europe faces an uncertain future with   Donald Trump, it is Merkel who stands in direct opposition to him.   She is now the strongest leader in Europe to defend the integrity of the European Union and the liberal \u201dEuropean values\u201d that Orban and others have railed against.

One day, he stopped by his local Wells Fargo branch in Encinitas, Calif. and asked to withdraw his entire monthly salary in cash. In singles. It took 24 hours for the tellers to round up that many bills, so he returned the next day and took away the $100 stacks in a canvas bag. His oldest son, Daniel, who was 15 at the time, remembers the moment his father walked into the house and dumped the $10, 000 or so on a table. \u201cIt looked like he had robbed a bank,\u201d he said. After a pause to let it all sink in, Mr. Parker began peeling off bills. He told them about taxes, set aside money for a tithe to their church and made a big pile for the house payment. The singles piled up for soccer and scouting and hamburger night. By the end, there wasn\u2019t much left over. \u201cI was trying to make as big of an impact as I could, and I definitely had their attention,\u201d he said recently. Your children deserve to know what you make, too. It may sound improbable, but you can begin to initiate them when they\u2019re as young as 5 or 6, building their knowledge slowly and giving them the real answer while they\u2019re still teenagers. Handle it right, and it will be one of the most valuable lessons of their childhood. Here\u2019s the bigger problem this helps to solve: Money is a source of mystery to children. They sense its power, so they ask questions, lots of them, over many years. Why isn\u2019t our house as big as my cousin\u2019s? Why can\u2019t I have a carnivorous plant terrarium? Why should I respect my teachers if they earn only $60, 000 per year? (Real question!) Are we poor? Why didn\u2019t you give money to the man who asked you for some? If my sister can have    Beats by Dre headphones, why won\u2019t you get me the   Lego Mindstorms set? (It\u2019s only $349, and it\u2019s educational, Mom!) We adults, however, tend to do a miserable job of answering. We push our children\u2019s money questions aside, sometimes telling them that their queries are impolite, or perhaps worrying that they will call out our own financial hypocrisy and errors. Sometimes we respond defensively and viscerally, barking back, \u201cNone of your business,\u201d unintentionally teaching our children that the topic is off limits despite its obvious importance. Others want to protect their children from a topic many of us find stressful or baffling: Can\u2019t we keep them innocent of all of this money stuff for just a little bit longer? But shielding children from the realities of everyday financial life makes little sense anymore, given the responsibilities their generation will face, starting with the outsize college tuitions they will encounter while still in high school. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, like not telling them about how their bodies are going to change during puberty,\u201d said Amanda Rose Adams, a mother of two in Fort Collins, Colo. \u201cThat\u2019s how kids come out of college $100, 000 in debt with an English degree. \u201d Or not knowing how and why to start saving right away for retirement, or how to pick a health insurance plan. This does not mean that children are entitled to your tax returns the first time they ask how much you earn. Financial transparency comes only with readiness, as Joline Godfrey, a family financial education consultant, puts it, and it takes a decade or so to give them enough knowledge and context to make the information meaningful and for you to feel safe sharing it. Start by using the same, simple line every time your child asks you a money question: \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Don\u2019t say it with disapproval or defensiveness make it clear that you\u2019re glad your child asked. This is a stalling tactic to give you time to think of an answer. (It also works well with questions about sex and drugs.) Even better, it can allow you to figure out exactly what is on your child\u2019s mind. If two parents are fighting about money and a child overhears, it\u2019s natural to wonder how much the family has or if it has enough. At that moment, it can be easy to reassure a child that the family is fine  \u2014   if that\u2019s true  \u2014   and that the argument was merely about the best way to use what it does have. Still, when it comes to your children\u2019s financial initiation, you don\u2019t want to play defense, merely responding to their inquiries. Instead, you want to build their awareness slowly of how to build a household budget. Start with something that you spend money on regularly  \u2014   anything, really. Children as young as 6 or 7 can begin to understand the grocery bill. They often tag along to the store or add to the wish list each week, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to introduce the idea of wants and needs as you navigate the aisles. Some children even get in on the couponing, collecting a portion of the savings from the parents. This is all part of helping them answer basic family budget questions: What do we spend each month to cover the necessities, and what do we choose to spend on things that we merely want? Our spending isn\u2019t a secret in the first place children see plenty. But watching us whip out plastic cards in the store or in front of the computer, completely out of context, may give them the wrong impression entirely, which is why it\u2019s good to introduce them to all of the expenses before they are teenagers. Some parents start with even larger line items. Trisha Jones, a    mother in Norfolk, Va. sends her children, who are 6 and 8, to private school. Each month, she has them sit with her while she pays the tuition online, asking them to click the button. \u201cWe jokingly say that it costs $92. 50 to send them each to school every day,\u201d she said, adding that they know that the daily number is akin to a nice Lego set. \u201cBut it\u2019s a privilege to go to the school that they do, and we want them to know that we are making sacrifices to send them there. \u201d Other families focus on expenses that derive from the children\u2019s extracurricular interests. When the local ballet studio raised prices just as her    daughter was increasing her commitment to dance, Rebecca Miller Goggins showed her the bills. A professional   who lives in Northampton, Mass. Ms. Goggins is used to being direct about money and gave her daughter the option of having one fewer lesson per week or cutting back elsewhere. Rather than reducing the number of lessons, her daughter started babysitting more and contributing money toward her pointe shoes. In the Adams house in Colorado, every line item in the budget is available for inspection by the children, who are 10 and 11. Each Sunday, the family reviews it. \u201cYou feel deprived if you\u2019re not part of the   process,\u201d said Ms. Adams, a program manager for a technology company. Her children are now involved in deciding on   too. Skipping dinner at the Vietnamese restaurant means more money in the Disneyland fund. One idea one of the children had: Rather than hang out at the Barnes  Noble after dinner, where spending temptations abound, they head to the public library. If your child knows how to use the Internet, you might be shocked by how much financial information about your family he or she may already possess. Search your home address: Did the approximate value of your home pop up? Mine, too, and it will happen when many children search their addresses for the first time and find the Zillow estimates. Once a child discovers this, it\u2019s a quick step to looking up the address of every friend. Then comes research into salary information. If it can\u2019t be found, the child may go looking through your belongings for your tax returns, as I did as a young snooper. At this point, you may be in a bit of a pickle. Information about household income and home values is   data it ought to stay in the family. But if you can\u2019t control exactly when family members acquire some of it, you need to at least try to imprint the idea of discretion. The script can go something like this: We\u2019re trusting you with this information because we want you to know where our income goes, and we expect you to show the same maturity with other information you\u2019ve found yourself. The same principles apply with medical information, friends\u2019 secrets and other private things. \u201cWe\u2019ve had other issues that we\u2019ve talked about that are private and confidential,\u201d said Ms. Goggins, the   in Massachusetts. So she and her husband recently told their   and    daughters what they earn. \u201cThey\u2019ve proven themselves. \u201d As will many children in middle and high school. Most of them don\u2019t want their peers singling them out as having more or less than others, so they may try harder than you think to keep the information private. For some families, this advice will work only selectively. Ms. Adams, who wrote the book \u201cHeart Warriors\u201d about her son\u2019s heart disease, shields him from knowledge of the family\u2019s medical bills. Child patients often feel guilty for inconveniencing their families. Families who struggle generally, or are experiencing a period of unemployment, are naturally among the most reticent. Still, even the youngest generally understand when budgets have become tighter and want to know why. Pretending that there hasn\u2019t been a reduction in income or some other difficult circumstance doesn\u2019t help them. \u201cIf you are not talking to them, then they are drawing their own conclusions,\u201d said Sara Solnick, an associate professor of economics at the University of Vermont who has written about social comparison. Leveling with them about the reality and how you\u2019re managing it may help ease their fears. When Andrea Dutton and her husband separated and she moved with her    daughter and    son to a smaller house in Gainesville, Fla. she addressed the matter simply. \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing to them about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to realize that the right decision is not always the easy one. I\u2019d rather have them see that you can do the right thing and get out of a bad situation even if it means taking a hit financially. \u201d Keep in mind that if you are planning on applying for financial aid for college, you will have no choice but to disclose your financial information when your child is a senior in high school. That\u2019s because anyone who wants financial aid must fill out a form called the Fafsa. It asks for information about income and assets. Parents sign it, and so must the students everyone attests to the accuracy of the information. Coming clean about income and assets can pose special challenges if you are truly wealthy you may worry that children will flaunt their good fortune or think they never have to work. But you don\u2019t get a pass: If you don\u2019t work (or don\u2019t work much) older children will wonder how the family affords its life. At the very least, it\u2019s worth trying some starter exercises, like showing your children the details of what a vacation or a second home actually costs. Explain, too, that it requires a great deal of money to throw off whatever dividends and interest contribute to the family budget, and that the investments that do so may not last or may not fall to the next generation if the children don\u2019t make something of themselves in college and beyond. Given the near inevitability that parents will have to disclose their incomes or their children will find out some other way, it\u2019s best to think of that moment of revelation and the years leading up to it as opportunities. For those of us who have at least a little bit more than what we need to scrape by, what we spend says a lot about what we stand for how we determine value is a reflection of our values. The same is true for whatever we have left over each month. How much do we save? Why does it fluctuate? Who has helped us, what do we give to people who have less, and why don\u2019t we give more? It\u2019s impossible to answer these questions for children with conviction and clarity if they don\u2019t know the size of the number at the beginning of the equation. When Mr. Parker came home with his big bag of money from Wells Fargo 20 years ago, he was acting as much on reflex as anything else. \u201cI just remember distinctly that I never knew myself growing up, and I felt it was a big disadvantage,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea what it would take to take care of a family. \u201d That night, the lessons couldn\u2019t have been clearer: The family\u2019s life was expensive. Every decision mattered. Savings and faith were high priorities. And there wasn\u2019t much left at the end of the month. His son, Daniel, is now an adult and has two small children. He and his wife intend to share their financial information with their children as they grow. \u201cHe had little tolerance for entitlement in any of us,\u201d Daniel said of his father. Scott Parker did have confidence that his children would know what to do with the information he had literally dumped onto the table. \u201cI wasn\u2019t swearing anyone to secrecy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you, it never became an issue. I figure that whatever the risk was, it was worth it. \u201d","short_description":"Parents are encouraged to be transparent about their finances with their children to teach them about money management.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Poll: 55% of voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of health care","content":"Washington (CNN) Most voters    55%    say they disapprove of President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of health care, while just 35% said they approved, according to a new Fox News poll released Wednesday.

Race is    in the Texas pool party case. And Team USA wins, It\u2019s Tuesday, and here are five things to know for your New Day:   NEW YORK PRISON ESCAPE, Just a theory: Did Richard Matt and David Sweat seduce their way out of prison? A direct question, to be sure, but it is plausible, says a noted criminologist. He thinks a female prison employee whom cops questioned about the escape may have somehow \u201dsuccumbed\u201d to the two men and agreed to help them. So basically she had a thing for bad boys? Yep, there\u2019s even a name for it: hybristophilia. As the manhunt continues, police are pretty much treating her like an accomplice.    TEXAS POOL PARTY VIDEO, The race question: The first time you saw the video, you knew it would come up: did race play a factor in the pool party melee? Residents of the neighborhood where the incident took place say no the kids were essentially trespassing and the police response was necessary, they say. The teens involved and some activists    who held a rally yesterday    said yes, the kids were targeted by some residents and the cops because they were black. The officer at the center of this controversy, identified late last night as Eric Casebolt, remains on administrative leave.   ANGOLA 3, Not yet out: Albert Woodfox may be getting out of a Louisiana prison, after four decades in solitary lockup. Don\u2019t remember Woodfox? He was part of the   \u201dAngola 3,\u201d a group of prisoners accused of killing a prison guard in 1972. The other two members of the \u201d3\u201d were released after their convictions were overturned or vacated. A judge ruled yesterday that Woodfox should go free because of his age, health and questions over whether he\u2019d get a fair third trial in Louisiana. Predictably, the state sees things differently. Louisiana\u2019s attorney general filed an emergency stay to block the judge\u2019s order.   ISIS  Wives\u2019 tale: The fight against ISIS isn\u2019t going well (which President Obama hinted at yesterday). So the U. S. and its allies are looking for any advantage they can find. Have they found one with ISIS wives? After killing a senior ISIS leader last month and capturing and interrogating his wife, the U. S. believes the wives of ISIS figures may be more deeply involved in the terror group\u2019s operations than previously thought. This may be because ISIS thinks U. S. intelligence pays less attention to them. Not anymore.   WOMEN\u2019S WORLD CUP, Step 1: Team USA took a first step toward a World Cup championship yesterday with a   win over Australia. Not the most convincing of victories, and the women can certainly play better. But, as they say in the world of sports cliches: a win is a win is a win. Up next for the Americans is Sweden, in a match set for Friday.   Those are your five biggies for the day. Here are a few others that are brewing and have the Internet buzzing.

The use of the advanced tools suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved in the hacks, a person familiar with the matter said, adding that it was more than a US intelligence assumption at this point. But neither of the sources said they knew of specific intelligence that directly ties Putin to the attack. US officials briefed on the investigation say the hacking has continued largely unabated since last month\u2019s election, and President Barack Obama on Thursday vowed to take action against Russia. \u201dWe don\u2019t have Putin\u2019s fingerprints on anything or a piece of paper that shows he signed the order, but the nature of the operation was such that this had to be approved by top levels of the Russian government,\u201d a senior administration official with access to the intelligence on the hacking told CNN. \u201dThe intelligence community has assessed that in order for this operation to have been executed, it could not have been done without the highest levels of the government, including the President himself.\u201d The US official said there are two entities in Russia capable of doing this kind of work, but would not name either one. The tools the Russians used are understood by the US and have a unique \u201dsignature.\u201d The official said the sophistication of the tools used means that a   Russian government authority would have been required to carry the prolonged effort to steal emails and data from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, among other targets.   The US believes Putin most likely gave his cyberexperts broad direction to attempt to hack US political institutions. The US believes once the hackers got into the DNC system, they would have instantly reported back to the Russian leader, who would weigh in on what to do with the data. WikiLeaks, which distributed the hacked information, may well not even know it came from Russia. But under Russian command and control procedures that US intelligence understands, it would be expected that Putin would be the final authority to decide on giving it to WikiLeaks. The sources did not say when the US came to this analysis of the cybertools used. CNN reported Wednesday that US intelligence believed Putin was involved when they issued their public statement in October. Putin\u2019s involvement, Multiple national security, intelligence and congressional sources told CNN that the US intelligence assessment continues to be based on the analysis of intelligence, not any evidence directly linking Putin to the effort. Analysis of the digital footprint and intelligence, including from human sources, has led to the thinking in the intelligence community to conclude that Russians carried out the cyberhack and that it would not have happened without Putin\u2019s consent, according to intelligence, congressional and other administration sources.   That belief was alluded to in the October 7 statement from the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security that stated \u201donly Russia\u2019s   officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest implied that statement was clear in identifying Russian leaders, including Putin, in US election meddling.  \u201dAt the risk of editorializing, when I read that statement for first time in early October, I didn\u2019t think it was particularly subtle,\u201d Earnest said. He emphasized he did not have an additional intelligence assessment to share naming Putin specifically as being behind the cyberattacks. Intelligence exists that could be interpreted as Putin was aware of the hacks beyond just an assumption that the hacking operation could not happen without Putin\u2019s approval, according to two of the sources.    But the sources said there is certainly no obvious intelligence linking Putin, such as a signed order.  One source explained that while the thinking in the US intel community is that Putin was aware of this effort, it doesn\u2019t mean he knew all the details and was personally tracking the program. The source used the analogy that when a drone strike happens, Obama authorizes it but isn\u2019t involved in every step. Since October, the CIA has refined its analysis based in part on new intelligence, but the government officials said that assessment continues to be based mostly on the reading of circumstantial evidence. Indeed, a more   assessment by the CIA was being produced before the election, but the agency purposely did not brief Congress at the time on that information in an attempt to not get stuck in the middle of politics during the campaign, as the FBI did, according to several of the sources.  That may have backfired, as   Donald Trump is citing the fact that the information is coming out only after the election, timing seen by the Trump transition team as an effort to delegitimize his election victory. According to an administration official familiar with the matter, the October 7 statement is still the operative bottom line. According to the source, when the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the senior most Russian officials had to have authorized the hacking, \u201dwho else would that be but Putin? This is an authoritarian regime.\u201d Hacking continues, Russian cyberhacking activity has continued largely unabated since the election, including against US political organizations, US officials briefed on the investigation told CNN. Among the attempted cyberbreaches are phishing attempts targeting Clinton\u2019s campaign, one official said. The attempt to breach the Clinton campaign was unsuccessful, investigators believe.  The attempts appear to trace back to some of the same Russian hackers behind the breaches of Democratic Party organizations in the past year, one official said. The FBI has expanded its ongoing probe of Russian hacks to include the more recent attempts.  Russians \u201dcontinue to do all kinds of stuff\u201d against American political organizations, think tanks and thought leaders, another US official said.  \u201dIt\u2019s not like the    deal here. They continue to engage in this operation around the clock,\u201d the official said. This person said the US is constantly trying to shut down access to different avenues for cyberattacks. \u201dThere\u2019s a lot that gets done with our own security services,\u201d the official said. In terms of retaliation against Russia, this person said a variety of options are on the table, but everything is being carefully considered because \u201dright now, it\u2019s like the old cold cyberwar and the last thing you want to do is turn it into a hot shooting war.\u201d The continued activity suggests that despite the election won by Trump, who was openly favored by the Russian government, Russian intelligence hasn\u2019t curbed its collection on the US political system. US intelligence and law enforcement officials believe even with a new president considered more friendly to Russia, the Russian intelligence agencies will continue to carry out such hacks.  A senior Clinton campaign official told CNN they received notice \u201da state actor\u201d was trying to hack private Gmail accounts as recently as December 6. The campaign official said they were informed the US election assistance office also had a cyberhacking attempt. Obama vows action, Obama on Thursday vowed retaliatory action against Russia. \u201dI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing,\u201d Obama told National Public Radio. He said he directly confronted Putin about a potential US response, and said his counterpart acknowledged his stance. \u201dMr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it,\u201d Obama said. Obama and Putin conferred on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China in September. Afterwards, Obama told reporters he raised cybersecurity with the Russian leader. Officials have said US actions against Russia may not be revealed publicly.","short_description":"US officials believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved in the hacking of the US election.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"New York Times Hits Donald Trump Over Guest Workers at Mar-a-Lago - Breitbart","content":"HOUSTON, Texas  \u2014   The New York Times is out with a new investigative report on debate day here, accusing billionaire and national GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump of hiring foreigners into jobs at    that Americans could do. [\u201cSince 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers there. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Charles Bagli and Megan Twohey wrote on Thursday. \u201cIn all but a handful of cases,    sought to fill the jobs with hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries. \u201d  This, the Times argues, is hypocrisy of the highest order by Trump. Bagli and Twohey continued: In his quest for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Trump has stoked his crowds by promising to bring back jobs that have been snatched by illegal immigrants or outsourced by corporations, and voters worried about immigration have been his strongest backers. But he has also pursued more than 500 visas for foreign workers at    since 2010, according to the United States Department of Labor, while hundreds of domestic applicants failed to get the same jobs. The report in the Times details how many foreign workers Trump has sought to bring in according to Labor Department records.  Bagli and Twohey wrote: For at least 15 years, according to the Labor Department, Mr. Trump\u2019s properties have requested   visas, including at    the former estate of the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, where the initiation fee alone is $100, 000. Housekeepers from abroad ensure that the venue\u2019s eight seaside cabanas are spotless, the Dorian stone from Genoa shines and the lavish guest rooms and suites in the main house, an     mansion in the   style, are fresh for visitors. Foreign workers prepare meals and serve them at the beachfront bistro or the main dining room, and deliver cocktails at wedding receptions in the elegant White  Gold Ballroom or the more recently built Donald J. Trump Ballroom. From October to May, tourism\u2019s high season in Palm Beach, Mr. Trump himself can often be found at the club on weekends. Trump, they wrote, also sought guest workers at his other properties in South Florida and in Virginia and New Jersey. \u201cHe has also sought guest workers at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and Trump National golf club and spa in Jupiter, as well as at his vineyard in Virginia and golf clubs in New Jersey,\u201d Bagli and Twohey wrote, before adding that it\u2019s thus far unclear how many visas he\u2019s actually gotten: It is not clear how many visas were actually granted to    or other Trump properties. While the Labor Department certifies a company\u2019s need for visas, it is up to Homeland Security and the State Department to grant them, and those departments said they were unable to provide information on how many visas each employer had received. Mr. Trump and other resort owners use a type of visa, designated   for temporary,   nonfarm workers there is a nationwide limit of 66, 000 such visas a year. Before it can be granted approval to hire foreign workers through   visas, an employer has to advertise the openings on a state website of job listings and twice in a local newspaper, and to report the number of local applicants and hires to the federal government. According to records    submitted to the Labor Department, it had received at least 296 local names for 520 seasonal jobs since 2010. Some applied directly to the club others were referred through a job placement service.    hired 17, about 6 percent of the local applicants, the records show. The report proceeds to detail stories of several Americans who sought jobs at    Trump\u2019s luxurious south Florida resort and golf course, but didn\u2019t get them for whatever reason as, for any American not hired, the employer must inform the Labor Department why that happened. \u201cAmong the reasons    gave: that the applicants could not be reached or were not qualified, as Mr. Trump suggested in his recent interview and that they did not want the jobs,\u201d the Times reporters wrote \u2014  after previously quoting Trump saying the same thing earlier in the article. \u201cThe only reason they wouldn\u2019t get a callback is that they weren\u2019t qualified, for some reason,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cThere are very few qualified people during the high season in the area. \u201d Delray Beach\u2019s Austin L. Cohen, who had applied for a job, said the job didn\u2019t fit his needs \u2014  which means he didn\u2019t fit the qualifications and chose not to take the job. \u201cThat [Trump\u2019s explanation] was the case for Austin L. Cohen of Delray Beach, who got a call from    and a tour of the   resort after sending in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a wait staff position that paid $10. 60 an hour for at least 30 hours a week,\u201d Bagli and Twohey wrote. \u201cMr. Cohen said that he ultimately chose to keep looking for a permanent job, and that he wanted benefits the job listing did not mention any. \u201d They then quoted Cohen confirming that. \u201cIt was more like a temporary position,\u201d Cohen told The Times. \u201cYou work six months and then you\u2019re out of work again. It was my decision not to take the job. \u201d The Times added several other American workers had turned down    positions for other reasons. \u201cSome applicants said they decided against working at    because, like some other private clubs, it discourages gratuities its job listings say \u2018no tips,\u2019\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cLocal labor analysts say that private clubs often lose job candidates to restaurants where tipping is permitted. \u201d The Times did quote one single woman who said she would have taken a job at    after an interview but never heard back. \u201cBut Renee L. Seymore, who applied to be a waitress at    last year, said she would have gladly taken the job, and thought her chances were good,\u201d the Times wrote before quoting Seymore directly. \u201cThey told me I had a great interview,\u201d Seymore, who is    and previously worked in a barbecue restaurant, said. \u201cBut I never heard anything back. \u201d Trump\u2019s team has not yet provided an explanation for why Seymore wasn\u2019t hired \u2014  but it could be for any variety of reasons that are as yet unclear. \u201c   did not respond to a question about why Ms. Seymore was passed over,\u201d the Times wrote, adding an explanation for how the newspaper obtained her name and others. \u201cThe New York Times obtained the names of Mr. Cohen, Ms. Seymore and other applicants through Florida\u2019s   law, but the   records did not give the reasons for not hiring particular candidates. \u201d The Times, buried in the next line, notes that many of the people who didn\u2019t get jobs there had criminal records. \u201cSeveral other applicants contacted by the Times had criminal records, but    did not state that as a reason for rejecting anyone,\u201d the Times wrote. The Times also, later in the piece, quoted another worker who said he was turned away from one of Trump\u2019s other properties but now works at a competing club. \u201cLocal workers like Bonafacio Quevedo say they are being forced to compete with the imported workers,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cHe said he was turned away from Trump International Golf Club when he applied in 2012, despite having previously worked as a waiter there and at   . Today he works full time at another club nearby. \u201d Trump\u2019s rivals immediately pounced on the story, as the campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) \u2014  who has faced serious questions for his work on behalf of increasing immigration to the detriment of American workers \u2014  circulated it to reporters on Thursday. The Times story certainly raises some tough questions \u2014  questions Trump will undoubtedly need to answer, and his team has yet to provide a detailed explanation to Breitbart News or to other media outlets on them \u2014  but the   National Review took the story a step further into an accusation against Trump that doesn\u2019t hold weight. Charles C. W. Cooke, who is   and   in a Thursday piece first posted about Trump being a \u201crank hypocrite on immigration,\u201d quoted from the Times story: Or, put another way, Trump has deliberately chosen to hire foreign workers to fill those jobs that \u2018Americans just won\u2019t do,\u2019\u201d Cooke wrote. \u201c17 out of 300? That\u2019s 5. 6 percent. 17 out of 500? That\u2019s 3. 4 percent. Bad! So what\u2019s Trump\u2019s excuse? That\u2019s he\u2019s a businessman and that these are the realities on the ground? That, I\u2019m afraid, won\u2019t wash. When Disney behaved like this, there was a loud and sustained outcry from . . . well, no less than Donald Trump himself. Cooke is right in that part of his story \u2014  unless Trump comes up with a believable explanation for this, such as the explanation he\u2019s used for political donations, which is that he was taking advantage of a broken system to benefit his bottom line but understands better than anyone else how it\u2019s broken \u2014  is that Trump looks like a hypocrite on this. But where Cooke is wrong is where he takes his story next, in comparing what Trump did to Disney and other technology companies having their American workforces train   workers to replace them. Those American workers were then fired after they trained their foreign replacements. \u201cIn an interview with Breitbart, Trump argued that Disney should be forced to rehire any Americans it had overlooked or replaced,\u201d Cooke wrote. The argument that Trump\u2019s actions were as bad as Disney\u2019s is silly. Trump didn\u2019t hire Americans, then bring in foreigners for a cheaper rate on visas, have those Americans he originally hired train those foreigners to do their jobs, then fire the Americans.

In a nation that is over 70% Christian, we\u2019d prefer not to think that a church    a place of peaceful reflection and spiritual striving    could become a target for violent hatred and the scene of wanton slaughter. But that is what happened, and not for the first time. In a land striving to free itself from the poison of racism and making notable forward strides    we have twice elected a black man as President of the United States    we must also reckon with the fact that a racially motivated massacre is the latest in what the Justice Department says are nearly 300, 000 hate crimes committed each year, which is about the same number as a decade ago. And in a country that boasts to the world of powerful democratic institutions, our Congress, President, state lawmakers and civic institutions appear powerless to find agreement on even the simplest and most basic controls on the proliferation of firearms, despite polls suggesting overwhelming public support for stronger background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and the  . The suspected killer arrested for the Charleston massacre may have been both. In short, we\u2019d like to think of ourselves as a place where faith, tolerance and robust democracy all coexist in happy abundance. But the alleged rampage by    Dylann Storm Roof places all that in doubt.  \u201dThere is something particularly heartbreaking about a death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship,\u201d said a somber President Obama from a White House podium. But surely the president remembers the spate of arson fires that destroyed 66 black churches across the South across an   stretch. The wave of fires led startled members of Congress to swiftly enact the Church Arson Prevention Act, hastily signed into law by   Bill Clinton, which stiffened penalties for acts of vandalism and desecration of religious sites. \u201dThe people burning down black churches in the South are generally white, male and young, usually economically marginalized or poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on drugs, rarely affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism,\u201d is how the \u201dWashington Post\u201d summarized the phenomenon in 1996.  Nearly 20 years later, that profile appears to largely describe Roof, a poorly educated young white man with a drug problem who chose a black church as a target of racist aggression.  \u201dUnfortunately there are thousands of young men like (Roof) who are looking for an identity larger than themselves,\u201d says Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group. \u201dWe\u2019ve seen a drifting away from organized white supremacy and the prevalence of lone wolf attacks.\u201d Former Sen. Rick Santorum, a conservative evangelical candidate for President, seems to have forgotten the wave of attacks in the 1990s, offering the unlikely theory that the massacre was an attack on Christians that had little or nothing to do with race.  \u201dIt\u2019s obviously a crime of hate. Again, we don\u2019t know the rationale, but what other rationale could there be? You\u2019re sort of lost that somebody could walk into a Bible study in a church and indiscriminately kill people,\u201d Santorum told a New York radio host. \u201dThis is one of those situations where you just have to take a step back and say we  \u2014   you know, you talk about the importance of prayer in this time and we\u2019re now seeing assaults on our religious liberty we\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s a time for deeper reflection beyond this horrible situation.\u201d Santorum\u2019s theory feels like an attempt to slip past the obvious markers indicating the massacre was about race, not religion. Photos have circulated of Roof sporting the symbols of fallen, failed regimes built on white supremacy. He wore patches of flags from apartheid South Africa as well as that of Rhodesia, now known as Zimbabwe. And Roof\u2019s license plates bore replicas of the Confederate Battle Flag, flown by the traitors who violently tried to split from America to form a slaveholding empire in the 1860s. Much has been made of the fact that the Confederate flag flies in front of the South Carolina statehouse, and by law cannot simply be lowered even though official flags were lowered to   in the wake of this week\u2019s massacre.  \u201dLet Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, look out her window at the flag of treason that is flown proudly at her state capitol and think about these things, and speak of them, before she pronounces herself so puzzled at how something like this could happen in South Carolina, the home office of American sedition,\u201d writes Charles Pierce at Esquire. com. By gruesome coincidence, a ruling from the Supreme Court, issued on the same morning Roof was arrested, held that the state of Texas can refuse to issue license plates with the Confederate battle symbol. A group called Sons of Confederate Veterans had sued in an attempt to force the state to allow the flag design on official,   vanity plates.  There\u2019s no need to obsess over the Confederate Flag issue. Those who cloak themselves in the symbol reveal more about themselves than they might realize    and if they\u2019re comfortable waving the same flag that modern racists have claimed as a standard, so be it. A more important question is what the future holds.  Obama seems resigned to the reality that Congress won\u2019t pass any form of firearms control, no matter how many murdered bodies pile up from one mass shooting after another. The politics that enable a troubled man to get a gun need a second look. So does our simplistic faith that young people will rescue the country from its political and cultural ills. As America moves toward a more diverse society    it\u2019s estimated that nonwhites will be a majority by the year 2040    we want to think young Americans are more educated and tolerant than the rest of us, free of   views on race,   marriage and other social issues. But that\u2019s not necessarily true: polls show that the   millennial generation of people born after 1980 hold views on race that aren\u2019t all that progressive.  \u201dThe fact of the matter is that millennials who are white  \u2014   that is, members of the group that has always had the most regressive racial beliefs, and who will constitute a majority of U. S. voters for at least another couple of decades  \u2014   are, on key questions involving race, no more   than their parents,\u201d writes Sean McElwee in New York Magazine. \u201dThe only real difference, in fact, is that they think they are.\u201d South Carolina boasts the country\u2019s sole black U. S. senator and an   governor. It also glorifies its past as the   point of a war that killed more Americans than any other. Like the rest of the nation, the state should take time to honor and remember the victims of the massacre    but then do some painful   about how to make sure we don\u2019t keep creating broken,   monsters.

It\u2019s not my grandmother\u2019s   recipe. The classic Sicilian cassata is a spongecake layered with creamy sweetened ricotta, a heavenly combination. Elaborately decorated with colorful candied fruits, wrapped in marzipan, true cassata is a sight to behold. My simple summery version is covered with ripe red strawberries, but any fresh summer berries would be welcome, or slices of nectarine, peach or mango. The unswerving requirements for this cassata are a good spongecake and the best ricotta available. Look for the absolute freshest, tastiest ricotta most good cheese stores or Italian delis can supply it. It must be moist, with no sourness. A spoonful should feel creamy on the tongue, not grainy. It\u2019s worth tasting several kinds to see the broad range of ricotta types. Lightly sweetened and whisked to smoothness, this ricotta filling is spread over the cake layers as if it were frosting. Though   can sometimes have strict rules, there\u2019s a fair amount of leeway here. If you like lemon, you can increase the amount of lemon zest in the cake, for instance, or add a little to the filling. You may play around with the syrup, replacing grappa with light rum, or you may use limoncello instead, or a honey syrup or orange liqueur. And you may decrease the sweetness of the cake or filling, if desired, without compromising flavor. Ideally, the spongecake should be made a day ahead, so it is easily sliced into thin layers. And then the cassata should be assembled at least several hours in advance to allow flavors to meld. Paint the cake layers with the lemon syrup, spread each layer with the ricotta cream, and give the cake an afternoon (or a day) in the fridge. Just before serving, pile the cake with ripe berries. You could toss them with a little sugar and lemon juice first, or just arrange them on the cake and dust them lightly with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Though my cassata is rather rustic looking, it is somewhat fancier than shortcake or trifle, so it could be used as a summer birthday cake. But it\u2019s really a celebration unto itself for lovers of summer fruit and good ricotta.

S. have blond hair, but 35 percent of female     U. S. senators and 48 percent of female CEOs at S&P 500     companies are blond.   \u2019 \u2019     Female university presidents are more likely to be blond, too.   \u2019 \u2019     Jennifer Berdahl and Natalya Alonso, who presented their     research at the Academy of Management\u2019s annual meeting early     this month, say some of this blond overrepresentation can be     explained by race and age biases in leadership pipelines.   \u2019 \u2019     Blond hair is primarily found in white people, and white people     take up a disproportionate amount of space in the top tiers of     business and politics, so it makes sense that there are a     disproportionate number of blondes.   \u2019 \u2019     And children are more likely to be blond than adults, meaning     the trait signals youthfulness. But whatever blond     privilege may exist in the upper echelons of power, it doesn\u2019t     apply to men: A study published in 2005 revealed that  of male     Fortune 500 CEOs were blond.   \u2019 \u2019     There would seem to be a paradox between the   stereotype     of the dumb blonde and this preference for blondes in     leadership positions. But  Berdahl     suggests that the two concepts aren\u2019t so contradictory after     all \u2014  the dumb blonde paradigm might actually explain blond     overrepresentation.   \u2019 \u2019     \u201cOur data suggest that blonde women are not only assumed to be     younger than their darker haired counterparts, but are also     judged to be less   and less willing take a     stand than other women and than men,\u201d she writes. \u201cIn other     words, Barbie can be CEO as long as she is young   docile,     or being blonde might allow her to be older and more forceful     than she otherwise could be. \u201d   \u2019 \u2019       Of course, many women \u2014  especially those around the age of the       average CEO or senator \u2014  dye their hair, so there are far more       people with   hair than naturally occurs. Still,       that dyed proportion wouldn\u2019t come close to accounting for       one in three female senators or one in two female CEOs being       blonde. Berdahl  that a     population would       do more to support her conclusions than disprove them.     \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u2019       \u201cIf women are choosing to dye their hair blonde, there\u2019s       something strategic about the choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the       package is feminine, disarming and childlike, you can get       away with more assertive, independent and [stereotypically]       masculine behavior. \u201d     \u2019 \u2019       In their research, Berdahl and Alonso got 100 men to rate       photos of blond and brunette women on attractiveness,       competence, and independence.     \u2019 \u2019       The two groups of women scored equally on the first measure,       but blondes fared worse on the latter two.     \u2019 \u2019       Then, the men were shown photos of the same woman with blond       hair and brown hair.     \u2019 \u2019       The majority chose to recommend the brunette over the blonde       for a job as a CEO or senator.     \u2019 \u2019       But when the men had to rate   female       leaders \u2014  photos of the same woman with blond or brown hair,       paired with quotes like \u201cMy staff knows who the boss is\u201d \u2014  they       thought the blond woman was warmer and more attractive than       her brunette twin.

[The Blaze reported Tuesday:  In a comment to TheBlaze, Thor, who previously called on people to pray for Trump\u2019s safety, said he was discussing a \u201chypothetical America under a dictator,\u201d reiterating that he was not referring to an \u201cassassination\u201d in his comments. \u201cWhat happens if a president suspends the Constitution and Congress does nothing?\u201d Thor asked. \u201cSafeguarding the Republic against despotism is a topic of conversation that dates back to the Founders. \u201d Offering additional clarification about his previous comments, Thor said, \u201cIf we had to unseat a president without the backing of the Congress, we would need a patriot along the lines of George Washington to lead the country from tyranny back to liberty. \u201d SiriusXM has suspended Glenn Beck from his morning time slot on the cable radio giant over Thor\u2019s statements in a Beck interview. This is what Thor said to Beck on air last week about Trump: THOR: He is a danger to America and I got to ask you a question and this is serious and this could ring down incredible heat on me because I\u2019m about to suggest something very bad. It is a hypothetical I am going to ask as a thriller writer. With the feckless, spineless Congress we have, who will stand in the way of Donald Trump overstepping his constitutional authority as President? If Congress won\u2019t remove him from office, what patriot will step up and do that if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president, his   authority, I should say, as president. If he oversteps that, how do we get him out of office? And I don\u2019t think there is a legal means available. I think it will be a terrible, terrible position the American people will be in to get Trump out of office because you won\u2019t be able to do it through Congress. BECK: I would agree with you on that and I don\u2019t think you actually have the voices we\u2019ve been talking about and we\u2019ve been talking about this   for a while. I think the voices like ours go away. I don\u2019t think we are allowed  \u2014   especially if things, and I believe the economy is going to go to crap, even if Jesus was in office.

[Horvath argued on CNN earlier this week that Trump\u2019s political speech is \u201chate speech,\u201d not constitutionally protected free speech. She also defended her instructions to city staff to refuse issuing events permits to the Trump campaign, saying that it was well within her right to do so in the name of \u201cdiversity. \u201d  On Thursday, about fifty demonstrators  \u2014   including many from the large local LGBT community rejected Horvath\u2019s stance as a violation of the First Amendment freedoms of speech and assembly.  Jake Lee, 46, a West Hollywood native who organized the rally, told Breitbart News: \u201cMayor Lindsey Horavath took it upon herself to ban Donald Trump from West Hollywod and that aggravated me. \u201d He said he has been an independent and Libertarian his entire life, but only recently changed his registration to Republican so he can vote for Trump in the California primary June 7. He confessed that he was \u201cforced to vote for [Mitt] Romney in the last election. \u201d Lee, who is married (to a woman) and has a young daughter, added, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of my gay friends throughout the years struggle to come out and tell the world who they are. \u201d Protesters held up   Trump signs adorned with the emblematic gay ride rainbow. One young man walked by and exclaimed in a surprised tone: \u201cOh, I guess there are gay people who support Trump?\u201d Lee added that \u201cconservative gay friends of mine are terrified and they are living in fear in their own city. They are shot down, shut out and afraid of being blackballed and blacklisted by their peers. It\u2019s terrible. \u201d He said that America is \u201cready for a businessman,\u201d and that watching The Apprentice changed his view of Trump for the better. \u201cI know staunch conservatives feel that Trump is not a true conservative, but looking at the way that he ran the show in the board room completely displayed so many conservative principles: You work hard, you move up the ladder. You don\u2019t work hard, you get fired. \u201d Ryan Stires, a gay man who resides in West Hollywood told Breitbart News \u201cI\u2019m a fiscally conservative, socially liberal Orange County Republican. And Trump has very much the same values as I do in regards to being fiscally conservative. \u201d Stires is an executive for Rally Life, a health and wellness company that provides   IV hydration to clients. He described it as the Uber of medical care. There were some divided households represented on Thursday evening as well. A man named Matteo, who moved to America from Italy several years ago, said that while he was voting for Trump, his wife is likely going to vote for Hillary Clinton. Matteo suggested his wife wants to see the first female president. \u201cShe reads the newspaper,\u201d Matteo said of his wife. \u201cAnd the newspaper loves Hillary Clinton. \u201d Several   broke out between   who were either undecided, or had unfavorable views of Trump. One discussion involved a debate over Islamic law, or sharia. Larry Clardy, 70, an American veteran, told Breitbart News he is voting for Trump due to his support for veterans and his promise to curb the nation\u2019s illegal immigration problem. \u201cIf Trump can do these two things, everything else will fall into place. Trump needs to build a wall and get rid of illegal aliens,\u201d Clardy said. \u201cHe\u2019s spending his own money. All these other candidates aren\u2019t spending their own money,\u201d Clardy added.  Stephen Brenes, 42, told Breitbart News: \u201cI\u2019m an American citizen that loves Donald Trump because he loves this county. He\u2019s the only one that represents the American citizen. \u201d Brenes said he is Catholic, and was born in Nicaragua before his family legally came to America when he was five years old. \u201cI\u2019m a registered Independent because I disowned the Republican Party because of the establishment. They don\u2019t represent the American citizen,\u201d he said. Only registered Republicans can vote for Trump on June 7 in the \u201cclosed\u201d California Republican presidential primary.

[The 18 Army officers in the Special Forces Qualification Course, or \u201c\u201d were visiting the National Security Council in early February, as a normal part of the course.  But this time, Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka, who was scheduled to speak to the students, had suggested that they meet the president. The plan was to take them into the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, but Trump decided to invite them into the Oval Office, to take pictures with them for their families. \u201cHalfway through the discussion, [Trump] said, \u2018Hey  \u2014   we\u2019re not supposed to do this, but follow me,\u2019 and he brought them all into the Oval Office, took a group photograph around the Resolute desk, and then  \u2014   throwing the schedules into a bit of a tizzy, said, \u2018OK that\u2019s not good enough,\u2019\u201d Gorka told Breitbart News in an interview. \u201cHe said, \u2018Everybody stand in the corner.\u2019 They all stood in the corner, and    we took photographs they can take home to their family with each future Green Beret next to the president at the Oval Office desk,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThat\u2019s how much he loves our soldiers  \u2014   our warriors,\u201d he said. Gorka had earlier brought up the meeting during remarks on a panel at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. Under Obama, he said, they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have even gotten into the West Wing. \u201d The Feb. 7 meeting, which was announced a day in advance, was not covered at the time by any news outlet. It also prompted criticism from Democrats that Trump was trying to use the military for political gain. A source familiar with the preparations for the event told Breitbart News shortly after the event occurred that the president\u2019s decision to meet with the officers set off an \u201cintense\u201d scramble. The source said NSC officials scrambled to notify Pentagon officials so they would not be surprised, and no preparation materials had been drafted  \u2014   such as background information on the course, expected topics of discussion, biographies of the students, talking points for the president, or other materials normally produced for a presidential meeting. The source characterized the meeting as a \u201cphoto op\u201d for the president to \u201conce again, wrap himself in the flag of the military. \u201d A White House official, responding to a query by Breitbart News, said the meeting was private and \u201ccouldn\u2019t be publicized. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy to take the time to do an event that couldn\u2019t be publicized,\u201d the official said. Photos from the event were never publicly distributed. Several Pentagon and Army officials denied there was any \u201cscramble\u201d and said that they were notified earlier in the week about the meeting and characterized it as a \u201c . \u201d \u201cArmy officials were notified of the photo opportunity with the President beforehand,\u201d Army Col. Patrick Seibert told Breitbart News. Gorka also dismissed the report there was a scramble and said the plan was conceived a week and a half in advance. \u201cThe opposition media will of course want to spin it, which is just ridiculous\u201d he said. During his first month in office, Trump has engaged with members of the military at least four times. He was sworn in on Jan. 20, and a week later on Jan. 27, he made his first trip to the Pentagon. There, he met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and attended the ceremonial swearing in of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A few days later, on Feb. 1, he made a private visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, to receive the remains of Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, a Navy SEAL who died of wounds during a mission in Yemen. Five days later, on Feb. 6, he visited MacDill Air Force Base to meet with Central Command commander Army Gen. Joe Votel and Special Operations Command commander Army Gen. Tony Thomas. He also ate lunch with enlisted service members, and spoke with representatives of the multinational   coalition. The next day, back in Washington, he would meet with the Special Forces Qualification Course students. Trump has also had several strategy sessions with Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, the White House official said. One top Democrat criticized Trump\u2019s meeting at Centcom, specifically his comment: \u201cWe had a wonderful election, didn\u2019t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that\u2019s the way it works. \u201d The visits have prompted Democratic criticism that the president was inappropriately politicizing the military. \u201cThe president\u2019s efforts to politicize the military, starting with his remarks at the CIA memorial, are becoming a troubling rhetorical pattern,\u201d Rep. Adam Smith ( ) ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said after Trump\u2019s visit to Centcom. Specifically, Smith cited Trump\u2019s remarks at Centcom, where he said, \u201cWe had a wonderful election, didn\u2019t we? And I saw those numbers, and you like me and I like you, that\u2019s the way it works. \u201d Multiple exit polls showed that military veterans voted for Trump   according to the Washington Post. A brief search of news articles showed that former President Obama had almost as many engagements with the military during his first month in office. During the    inaugural ball, Obama   in Illinois National Guard members who were serving in Afghanistan. He first visited the Pentagon on day nine of his administration, two days later than Trump in his administration. About three weeks in, he visited with family members of those killed in the 2000 USS Cole bombing. He visited Fort Myers in Florida about a week later.","short_description":"President Trump surprises Green Beret candidates by inviting them into the Oval Office for a group photograph.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"French MP: France Should Learn From Israel In War On Terror - Breitbart","content":"TEL AVIV  \u2014   Now that France has been forced into a war against terrorism, it would do well to take lessons from Israel, a French parliamentarian told Arutz Sheva in the wake of the murder of a priest in Normandy by Muslim extremists. [MP Meir Habib, who also served as vice chairman of the investigating committee for the 2015 terror attacks in France, said he was urging the country\u2019s leadership, which he claims is woefully unprepared to deal with the threat it is facing, to learn from Israel\u2019s   tactics.  \u201cI sought to go to Israel and to learn from the Israelis you\u2019re more experienced in dealing with terrorism. Thirty of us, French parliamentarians, met with the [Israeli] Prime Minister, Justice Minister, Police Chief, and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, Avi Dichter. \u201d \u201cWe see that the Islamic State doesn\u2019t start up with you [Israel],\u201d he added. \u201cUnfortunately as of now we are not ready in terms of intelligence and professional [training] to overcome the terrorists, either in terms of sealing the borders or in dealing with incitement in mosques,\u201d said Habib. \u201cEvery day we wake up to another terror attack, one time in Germany, another time in France the truck terror attack and the murder of the priest. \u201d Habib slammed the French government for not condemning the recent wave of terror attacks in Israel. When the car attacks and stabbings started in Israel, I called on France to condemn it they didn\u2019t and now it has come here. Also here we have millions of Muslims, most of them not radicalized, but the incitement in the mosques must be stopped. There was recently an imam who told dozens of children that anyone who listens to   music is a monkey or pig. The jihadist Satan wants us all to become jihadists, and it has nothing to do with territory. This is a total world war, [and it\u2019s] either us or them, and we must be determined against this trash. We need to destroy them, to launch ground operations with an international coalition and finish off IS. According to Habib, the French government ignored his calls to arrest Muslim sympathizers with the terrorists behind attacks on the kosher supermarket on January 9, 2015. \u201cAfter the attack on the Hyper Cacher [kosher supermarket] there were 30, 000 Muslims who identified with the murderers on Twitter. I told the Internal Minister to arrest them, but it didn\u2019t happen. And yesterday they slaughtered a poor    priest. \u201cCan you imagine what that is, to slaughter a priest in a church? Imagine if, God forbid, a rabbi would be slaughtered in a synagogue. Unfortunately this is just the beginning, and I said already years ago [we need to] wake up, open our eyes, we need to be determined and in the end we will be victorious. \u201d","short_description":"French parliamentarian urges France to learn from Israel's tactics in dealing with terrorism after recent attacks.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Germany: 100,000 Asylum Cases Re-Checked After Soldier Passes as Syrian","content":"BERLIN (AP)  \u2014   Germany\u2019s top security official says he\u2019s ordered the   of up to 100, 000 decisions granting asylum to migrants after uncovering mistakes in a smaller probe undertaken after a German soldier was able to pass himself off as a Syrian refugee in a bizarre   plot.

Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that White House press secretary Sean Spicer said will \u201dstrip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.\u201d The President reiterated his desire to target such cities Thursday when he spoke to a congressional Republican retreat.  But mayors in cities including Los Angeles, Boston and New York, as well as legal scholars, are saying not so fast.

They have underscored, she said, that the federal government can put some requirements on states when they parcel out funding, \u201dbut it can\u2019t be unduly coercive.\u201d  Key points in Trump\u2019s immigration executive orders, The need for a clear correlation between an action by a state and a threat to pull federal funding, was affirmed in the 1987 case South Dakota vs. Dole. That case looked at states that wanted to have a drinking age under 21. The federal government threatened to restrict highway funding in those states because they believed the underage drinking laws affected highway safety. In that case, the court ruled that the federal government wasn\u2019t being \u201dunduly coercive\u201d because underage drinking was indeed directly related to highway safety. \u201dThere is a constitutional boundary there,\u201d Tumlin said, \u201dand the boundary really is coercion    this notion of sanctity between what kinds of things localities get to decide and when the federal government can coerce them into action.\u201d One of the many complex facets of how Trump\u2019s executive order will play out is the fact that the term \u201dsanctuary city\u201d has no universal meaning. Police chiefs around the country have widely varying policies in the degree to which they cooperate with ICE agents and the lengths they will go to protect undocumented immigrants. Law enforcement leaders in some cities have argued it is invaluable to have a strong relationship with immigrant communities    and limit fear of deportation    when they are trying to solve crimes. Undocumented immigrants, they note, can serve as helpful informants. Tricky balance for mayors, But Democratic mayors face a tricky balance. Many of them want to develop a good relationship with the Trump administration, because they see opportunities to bring dollars to their cities if the new President embarks on the major infrastructure projects he has promised. Garcetti, for example, has spoken to Trump three times since he was elected about projects that they could collaborate on. But in the most liberal bastions of the country, mayors must also answer to their constituents who want to see path to citizenship for as many as 11 million immigrants living in the United States. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was among the most strident voices in the resistance this week    promising that if necessary, he would \u201duse City Hall itself to shelter and protect anyone who is targeted unjustly.\u201d Reality Check: Illegal immigration has plummeted, \u201dWe will not be intimidated by the threat to federal funding,\u201d Walsh said. \u201dWe have each other\u2019s backs, and we have the Constitution of the United States of America on our side.\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared Trump\u2019s executive order to be \u201dvague and in some ways contradictory\u201d and \u201dvery susceptible to legal challenge.\u201d \u201dIf they make an attempt to pull that money, it will be from NYPD, from security funding to fight terrorism,\u201d de Blasio told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota Thursday on \u201dNew Day.\u201d \u201dIf an attempt is made to do that, we will go to court immediately for an injunction to stop it.\u201d In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has welcomed Trump\u2019s Twitter offer to send in federal resources to reduce Chicago\u2019s shooting and killings, told reporters that the executive order wouldn\u2019t change anything. \u201dWe are going to stay a sanctuary city,\u201d he said during a press conference. Noting the executive order lacked any detail about what funds would be taken away, he decided to highlight the positive. \u201dI\u2019m going to take the President\u2019s offer to give us resources, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to focus,\u201d Emanuel said.

Read: Day 6 highlights, Peerless Siamand Rahman      Siamand Rahman is the strongest Paralympian of all time. He lifted an astonishing 310kg in the men\u2019s +107kg category to win gold and obliterate the world record. Never before had the magic 300kg mark been broken and, although there was a sense Rahman could achieve it tonight, his eventual score was completely unexpected. Rahman finished an unprecedented 75kg clear of his nearest rival, almost doubling his margin of victory from London 2012. Born without the use of his legs, Rahman\u2019s winning total was a full 30kg heavier than it was four years ago and his latest performance adds credence to the notion he is the most dominant strength athlete in the world. Weighing 169kg, the reigning world champion broke the world record twice before his final lift of 310kg    the equivalent of a male Siberian tiger. Ticket sales surge, It\u2019s looking increasingly like the ticket sales concerns prior to the Paralympics were much ado about nothing. After announcing just 12% of tickets had been sold two weeks before the start of the Games, officials confirmed Wednesday that over two million have now been snapped up by enthusiastic Cariocas. The carnival atmosphere in venues across Rio has now become one of the defining images of these Paralympics and the new sales figures cement Rio 2016 as the second best attended in history, behind only London 2012. \u201dTwo million is a fabulous achievement,\u201d Craig Spence, head of media at the International Paralympic Commitee (IPC) told the Rio 2016 website. Read: What\u2019s been inspiring Rio\u2019s Paralympic ticket turnaround? \u201dBearing in mind where we were at the end of August, when 200, 000 were sold, to sell 10 times that in a matter of weeks shows how the cariocas (Rio residents) have embraced these Games.  \u201dRio 2016 and the public deserve a pat on the back for turning this into a carnival of sport. We are expecting to break all our records for TV audiences.\u201d However, that number is unlikely to increase much with just 180, 000 tickets remaining. \u201dIf we get close to 2. 2m, we would beat our financial target and being in the two million bracket is the closest you could get to London 2012 (for which 2. 7 million tickets were sold).  \u201dFor us, the jackpot is the energy in the Olympic Park every day. That perception that Paralympic sport is cool and people are having a great time is the energy to change the perception towards people with impairment.\u201d The Paralympic Powerlifters of Nigeria, While Nigeria hasn\u2019t won Olympic gold since the turn of the millennium, its Paralympic powerlifters are in a class of their own.   Josephine Orji today became the ninth Nigerian to medal in Rio, breaking the world record (154kg) in the women\u2019s +86kg division. Seven of those nine have come under the bright lights of Riocentro Pavilion 2 where the powerlifting takes place, as Orji joins the likes of  Paul Kehinde, Lucy Ejike and Bose Omolayo atop the podium.  All of the above have not just won gold, but also broken world records in the ultimate test of strength. Roland Ezuruike, champion in the men\u2019s   competition, successfully lifted four times his own bodyweight    the equivalent of the average American male lifting 355kg.  Nigeria currently sits in an unprecedented top ten position in the medal table, but such success has prompted some to highlight the increasing disparity between Nigerian\u2019s Olympians and their Paralympic counterparts.  Abba Yola, the former director of the National Sports Commission, even told Nigeria\u2019s Daily Trust he hoped the Team Nigeria Paralympic contingent would \u201derase the shame of a dismal showing at the Olympic Games.\u201d  One thing\u2019s for sure, though    the Paralympic powerlifters of Nigeria are elevating their nation to greatness.  Former F1 driver wins paracycling gold on eve of   anniversary of crash, He had a clear perception he had cheated death.  With less than a liter of blood left in his body, Alex Zanardi\u2019s heart stopped seven times and he was read his last rites by a priest on the helicopter ride from the Eurospeedway to the hospital.  It was September 2001, and the Italian had been the victim of one of the most horrific crashes in the history of motorsport.  Fifteen years on from the day his car and body were severed in two, the former F1 and IndyCar driver enters the history books as a   Paracycling gold medalist.  Making up 20 seconds on his nearest rivals after the 20km Rio Circuit\u2019s halfway split, Zanardi was able to channel decades of racing experience to add to the golds he won on Brands Hatch circuit at London 2012.  The Italian could have turned away from elite sport forever, but his injuries have been   as well as   today, Zanardi considers his appalling accident one of the greatest opportunities of his life.   \u201dNormally I don\u2019t thank God for these type of things as I believe God has more important stuff to worry about, but today is too much, I had to raise my eyes and thank him,\u201d Zanardi told reporters after the race.  \u201dI feel my life is a   privilege.\u201d Now a single year shy of 50, the Italian overcame men half his age to take the title, despite originally taking up the sport to keep fit.  Zanardi will go down as one of Rio\u2019s great champions, and characterized his longevity by comparing himself to \u201da good Italian red wine\u201d when speaking to CNN in the aftermath of his last Olympic triumph.  In truth, it\u2019s one of sport\u2019s great miracles he\u2019s here at all. In spikes and on a bike, The   Kadeena Cox won the T38 400m final to claim her third medal of Rio 2016. Cox, already with   time trial gold and T38 100m bronze to her name, pulled clear of Chinese rival Chen Junfei in the last 20m to smash the world record by a second and a half. After running a conservative first 200m, Cox came into the final straight level with Junfei and home favorite Veronica Hipolito but, as the Brazilian\u2019s legs tied, Cox surged clear to take gold. \u201dI saw the Chinese girl inside me and thought \u2019Oh, I\u2019m gonna have to really work for this,\u2019\u201d Cox told Chanel 4. \u201dI was stumbling all over the place but I got there.

Walt Disney World, Sea World and Universal Orlando are spearheading the movement in hope of sidelining any fears tourists may have of being exposed to   mosquitoes. So far, no case of the dangerous Zika virus has been found that far north    Orlando is 228 miles on the Florida Turnpike from Miami. But experts say it\u2019s only a matter of time before the bug reaches the Magic Kingdom.  So Disney is getting set to reassure a key targeted demographic    in   years and their partners    that it will have repellent on hand to fend off any of the critters,   or not. \u201dIn an abundance of caution, we are accelerating preventative efforts throughout our property, including providing complimentary insect repellent to our guests along with helpful guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\u201d Disney said in a statement. \u201dWe have an extensive   and monitoring program in place, and we continue to work closely with local, state and federal experts on this topic.\u201d Pregnant women are most at risk with Zika because infections can damage the brains of unborn children, causing them to have smaller than normal heads, intellectual disability, poor motor and speech functions and seizures after birth. More importantly, researchers are continually learning more disturbing facts about the virus. Not only can it be passed through sex with an infected partner, but it is also been found to live in infected people\u2019s bodies much longer than originally thought. It is enough to scare any potential parent into thinking Florida may be better for retirement than vacationing, and theme parks in the Sunshine State need to tamp down that fear. \u201dWe will be offering complimentary mosquito repellent at key locations beginning tomorrow,\u201d  Universal spokesman Tom Schorder told CNN by email. \u201dUniversal Orlando already has an aggressive,   prevention and management program in place for mosquitoes and other environmental issues. And (we) will continue to work closely with local and state officials.\u201d   Starting Sunday, Sea World Parks  Entertainment will be offering guests \u201dcomplimentary   insect repellent\u201d at all of its venues, from Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay to SeaWorld, said spokeswoman Aim\u00e9e Jeansonne Becka. \u201dWe continue to stay in contact with local, state and federal health officials for the latest updates and recommendations,\u201d she said. Miami Zoological Wildlife Foundation has already been supplying \u201d    mosquito repellent\u201d for tours of its private zoo as well as ensuring there is no standing water on the property, said spokeswoman Paulina Naranjo. Disney has had its share of tragedies related to guests. In June, a Nebraska couple lost their    child to an alligator while on a Walt Disney World  beach one evening to watch a movie. A recent report by the state noted that at least two guests warned Disney employees that an alligator was prowling where children were wading. The theme park had not warned guests of the possible danger posed by gators, especially to small children, at the time of the attack. Disney has since erected signs warning of alligators and poisonous snakes and taken other measures to protect guests.","short_description":"Florida theme parks, including Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando, are offering complimentary mosquito repellent to protect against Zika virus.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Federer loses to teenager in Halle ","content":" (CNN) Roger Federer\u2019s bid for a ninth title in Halle was stopped abruptly in its tracks Saturday as he lost in three sets to German teenager Alexander Zverev in the semifinals.

Last week, Donald Trump closed the deal on the Republican presidential nomination while the Democrats escalated their internecine combat. [Trump has broadened his base of support by emphasizing job creation, economic growth and national security, while the two Democratic candidates have descended into a slugfest to determine which can genuflect lower before the radical,     fringe of the Democratic Party.  One thing Trump knows how to do is build. Time and again, he has assembled teams of the most capable, qualified people to create some of the world\u2019s most iconic properties. But Trump is not just a builder of luxury towers and hotels he is a leader and a creator of jobs. Trump knows how to spot opportunity and seize it. He has applied this same winning formula to campaigning. As an outsider to politics, he heard the people of this country calling for someone with business savvy and a willingness to break the political mold by speaking the truth. He devised a broad strategy, brought together the right team to execute it, and readily adapted it to the various attacks directed at him. As a result, a   number of voters (over 11, 540, 000) have responded to his vision and rewarded him with the Republican nomination. Compare this successful formula with the dysfunction engulfing the Democratic Party. Last week, while Trump was securing his party\u2019s nomination, the Democrats sank further into an abyss of their own making. Secretary Clinton has failed to put away her opponent and, troublingly, she has kowtowed to her party\u2019s radical, socialist,   flank in an attempt to peel supporters away from Senator Sanders. The latest example is her acquiescence to the appointment by Senator Sanders of extremists to her party\u2019s platform committee. Secretary Clinton\u2019s shift to the   to secure her party\u2019s nomination is a desperate attempt to defeat Senator Sanders that has justifiably alarmed many in the Jewish community, as well as millions of  . For example, Cornel West, a   democratic socialist who is now on the Democratic platform committee, and James Zogby, another Sanders\u2019 appointee to the platform committee, each espouse virulent   views and yet they find themselves holding positions of influence thanks to the Democratic candidates. For West, Hamas\u2019 indiscriminate and intentional attacks on Israeli civilians somehow pale in comparison to what he maliciously called the \u201cslaughter of innocent civilians\u201d by our ally, Israel. West has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \u201cwar criminal,\u201d and, in the same speech, to President Obama as one as well. What does it say about the state of a Democratic Party if the drafters of its national platform consider its   for the past eight years a war criminal? For his part, Zogby, one of the leading advocates of the   BDS movement in the U. S. has equated the \u201cplight of the Palestinians\u201d with the Holocaust. This comparison is grossly offensive to the memory of the millions of innocent people murdered by the Nazis and reveals a willful ignorance of history, blinded by hatred of Israel. These are the people who will be writing the platform for the Democratic Party. What hope does Israel have of receiving fair treatment in such an environment? What positions of influence would Secretary Clinton grant these dangerous individuals should she take the White House? Trump knows there is absolutely no moral equivalency between Hamas\u2019 use of civilian human shields to fire missiles at Israel and Israel\u2019s attempts to stop those missiles from launching in the first place. Trump will also seek to ensure that Iran never obtains nuclear weapons. Furthermore, Trump is the only candidate who stands any chance of facilitating a lasting peace in the   conflict through the use of his   abilities as a dealmaker. Compare the promises made by Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders of massive new taxes that would weaken America\u2019s competitiveness and cripple job creation with the promises made by Trump to bring jobs back to America and negotiate trade deals that actually make sense for our country, and you will know which candidate is actually capable of ensuring our country\u2019s economic success. Compare the Democrats\u2019 association with   BDS supporters and those who demonize our staunch ally Israel with Trump\u2019s   support of Israel and his unwavering dedication to the one true democracy in the Middle East, and you will know which candidate will be a true friend to Israel. Let us choose wisely while the choice is still ours to make. We need Donald J. Trump.

[Although Cologne was the focus of   sex attacks last year, there were also many cases that occurred in neighbouring Austria. New police reports show that the situation hasn\u2019t changed from last year with multiple cases of sexual assault, violence, and attacks with fireworks committed across the country, reports Der Standard.  In the city of Salzburg, a    woman from Germany is said to have been sexually assaulted by an    migrant. The Afghan migrant, who was said to be heavily intoxicated at the time, repeatedly tried to kiss the woman on the lips during the midnight celebration and grabbed her genital area. Friends of the woman were able to restrain the young migrant, preventing him from attacking the woman further, and called the police who arrived on the scene a short time afterwards. Police took the man to a medical clinic, due to his intoxication, and then to jail where he awaits possible prosecution. In the region of Tyrol, 11 women have come forward to police claiming to have been attacked by a group of men at the main marketplace in Innsbruck. The women say the group of attackers were   with short beards and had a \u201csouthern appearance\u201d  \u2014   a phrase used in Germany to describe men of North African origin. Two of the women were able to take photographs of the men with their mobile phones, but because it was dark, police were unable to verify their identities. Police described the attacks as being coordinated much like the Cologne attacks last year in which a group of men single out women, surround them and sexually assault them  \u2014   a rape game known as \u201cTaharrush\u201d in the Middle East and North Africa. In the Styrian capital of Graz a    woman claimed to have been sexually attacked by two men. The woman was on her way home at 1:30 am when two men she described as 25 to    and   grabbed her buttocks and her genitals. She managed to outrun the pair and report the crime to local police in the centre of the city. Before New Year\u2019s Eve, Vienna authorities handed out over 6, 000 \u201crape alarm\u201d key chains to deter   attackers. It is unknown if these alarms were able to stop any sexual assaults, though the reported cases of sexual assault in the Austrian capital of Vienna were minimal with only three cases reported.","short_description":"Multiple reports of sexual assaults in Austria, many committed by young men with a foreign appearance.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"More die in bathtubs than in terrorism. It\u2019s still worth spending billions to fight it","content":" (CNN) More Americans die from accidents in the bathtubs than from attacks by terrorists. Should we then care so much more    and spend so much more    to prevent terrorist attacks than bathtub mishaps? We think so. The reason is simply human nature. And the terrorist attack last month in Paris, on the eve of the critical French elections, showed once again that human nature is, in many ways, unchanging. Recent commentary in the pages of the New York Times and Financial Times and on blogs such as Lawfare has revived debate over whether we are spending too much time, effort, and resources on stopping terrorist attacks when very few Americans are killed by terrorists    by some estimates, approximately   the number who die each year in the bathtub. We strongly agree with those who consider that comparison a fallacy. Deaths from terrorism    even just attempted acts of terrorism    simply scare people in ways that other acts of violence do not. It\u2019s partly the randomness. It\u2019s partly the viciousness. It\u2019s partly the media attention that makes all of us relive each attack over and over. But whatever the reasons, people simply fixate on, and in turn react to, terrorism to a degree unmatched by other violence. And a lot flows from that. Because of voters\u2019 fears, terrorism can distort domestic politics    exactly as much of France, the rest of Europe, and the broader global community feared would occur after last month\u2019s terrorist attack on the Champs Elysees, and indeed, as we fear might happen, goaded by President Trump, the next time an attack occurs here in the United States. And terrorism can distort foreign policy, too, dragging countries into conflicts abroad or providing an excuse for doing so. This, of course, appeared to be part of the dynamic that, in the wake of the   attacks, shaped how the US public thought about going to war in Iraq in 2003    an especially notable influence in that Iraq bore no responsibility for those attacks.   In fact, terrorism can undermine the stability and political trajectory of entire regions. ISIS is, in a sense, more than a terrorist group, given its (shrinking) hold on territory in Syria and Iraq, but it has garnered the world\u2019s attention largely through its acts of terrorism beyond the territory it controls. And ISIS has changed the direction of much of the Middle East for at least a generation, setting back development in large swaths of territory, altering alliances throughout the region, and producing thousands of children raised to embrace barbaric violence and intolerant extremism. Much of the recent debate over the bathtub fallacy has been a statistical one, assessing whether the numbers really bear out the comparison. To us, that\u2019s beside the point.   So long as human nature yields a reaction to terrorism that shakes domestic politics, redirects foreign policy, and upends regional stability, terrorism demands our attention. Of course, so does the quite explicit expectation of the American public that its government protect it from this form of deliberately targeted, violent death in particular    whereas the American public has expressed no such concern about the accidental perils of the bathtub.   Recognizing the role that human nature plays in shaping reactions to terrorism reinforces the importance of building resiliency in our communities, societies, and polities to do what we can at least to mitigate the risks associated with those reactions.   There is a world of difference between demagogues who would hype the threat of terrorism to scaremonger and true leaders who can speak to the importance of dutiful preparation, effective response, and calm reflection before reaction.   In our time working on counterterrorism policy at the White House, we helped to ensure that President Obama prepared the American public for what could happen, and reassured the public when something, tragically, did happen. Indeed, certain swaths of the American public appeared to react to the horrific events in San Bernardino and later Orlando less in    fashion and more in line with the type of grim stoicism reminiscent of British and Israeli societies that have suffered longer series of terrorist attacks. But other loud voices    including, of course, the candidate who became our current President    continued to call for extreme measures in response  Building resilience where we can is important, because it can minimize the effects of terrorism. But pretending those effects are    or ever will be    the same as the effects of deaths from bathtubs elevates cold statistics over human nature. That\u2019s a dangerous basis for making policy.","short_description":"The article argues that despite more deaths from accidents in bathtubs than from terrorist attacks, the focus on terrorism is justified due to human nature and its impact on politics and foreign policy.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"NBC: Ramadan Ends in Sea of Blood","content":"This article originally appeared in NBC News:  With Ramadan drawing to a close on Tuesday, ISIS has fulfilled its promise of staining the Muslim holy month with bloodshed around the globe \u2014  taking credit for some of the deadly attacks that have killed hundreds in several countries, including in Iraq, Kuwait, Bangladesh, Turkey, Saudi Arabia.

S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201d[It has been eleven days since Carson sailed through his confirmation hearings before the committee on January 12.  Republicans outnumber Democrats on the committee twelve to eleven. Several of the Democrats on the committee are likely to vote to confirm Carson, while others, most notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) used Carson\u2019s confirmation hearings as an opportunity to grandstand against President Trump. Both Sen. Jon Tester ( ) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( ) questioned Carson in a friendly manner at the hearing. Tester and Heitkamp are among a number of Democrat senators up for   in 2018 in states won by President Trump in the 2016 general election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who scratch their head when you were nominated. What does he know about housing?\u201d Heitkamp told Carson at his committee hearing, adding that \u201cI thought about you as a neurosurgeon. You know, you just might be the right guy if you focus on why people are in poverty. \u201d \u201cYou talked about a holistic view, which I agree with,\u201d  Tester told him. On the day of the hearing, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper tweeted \u201c@SenatorTester says he plans on supporting @RealBenCarson for HUD Secy. \u201d In the event the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs votes to confirm Dr. Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday, which appears likely, the full Senate is likely to confirm him with ease. Meanwhile, one of President Trump\u2019s first executive orders signed within hours of his swearing in on Friday rescinded a small reduction in mortgage insurance premium rates that was announced on January 9 by former HUD Secretary Julian Castro as he was headed out the door. The reduction was scheduled to become effective on January 27. The last minute timing of the reduction announced by former Secretary of HUD Castro on January 9 was \u201csurprising,\u201d Dr. Carson told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Development at his confirmation hearing on January 12. The mortgage industry press was also caught off guard by the rate reduction, and reported on the political difficulties created by its last minute nature. \u201cWithin minutes of the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s announcement [on January 9] that it was cutting annual mortgage insurance premiums, observers were already wondering whether the incoming Trump administration would put a stop to the plan,\u201d The National Mortgage News reported when Castro announced the reduction: The FHA said it would cut the premium by 25 basis points, down to 60 basis points, starting on Jan. 27, a week after   Donald Trump is scheduled to take office. That gives Trump and his team a limited window to delay or scrap the cut. Observers said it will likely be a close call, but there are reasons why Trump may want to allow the premium cut to go through. As it turns out, those observers were wrong. One reason for Trump\u2019s decision was the failure of outgoing Secretary Castro to discuss the proposed cut with his proposed successor, Dr. Carson. \u201cCarson was not consulted about HUD\u2019s decision until it was made public on Monday morning because Castro said the move was \u201cmarket sensitive,\u201d the National Mortgage News reported: Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group, said stopping the premium cut could be a political liability for the new president. \u201cThe Trump administration would be accused on day one of raising mortgage costs for average Americans if it reverses the FHA move,\u201d he wrote to clients. \u201cIn addition, Trump\u2019s career has been real estate. It would seem out of character for him to be aggressively negative on real estate in his first week in office. \u201d Trump\u2019s executive order was seen by some in the mortgage and real estate industry as a needed step to safeguard the fiscal stability of the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, despite the perceived short term \u201cpolitical liability\u201d created by the last minute move by Castro. \u201cIf they stop a fee that hasn\u2019t been implemented, then it\u2019s   \u201d David Stevens, who now heads the Mortgage Bankers Association and is a former Obama administration official in the Federal Housing Administration,  told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cToday was really the last day to do it in order not to disrupt a whole lot of mortgage closings,\u201d Stevens added. \u201cThe order will affect millions of homeowners with an   mortgage. FHA backs about 16% of the country\u2019s new mortgages. FHA loans offer easier credit requirements, lower down payments and smaller closing costs, attractive perks for   home buyers,\u201d the Times reported. In November, more than two months before former Secretary of HUD Castro announced his decision to reduce mortgage insurance premiums, Housing Wire reported that \u201cEd Golding, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s principal deputy assistant secretary for housing . . . [said] that the FHA is not considering cutting its mortgage insurance premiums, despite the FHA\u2019s flagship fund showing growth for the fourth year in a row. \u201d But in November the Mortgage Business Association\u2019s Stevens opposed the cut on grounds of fiscal responsibility. Responding to a report from the FHA  released that month, the agency\u2019s Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund \u201ccontinued its growth of the last few years,\u201d Stevens noted, adding that \u201c[a]n important subtext to this report is the continued volatility in the HECM book of business, which this year turned negative, dragging down the overall value of the MMIF. \u201d \u201cAn HECM loan is the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s reverse mortgage program,\u201d David Chee, a reverse mortgage specialist, writes: An HECM reverse mortgage enables the homeowner to withdraw some of the equity in their home with limitations or to withdraw a single disbursement   payment at the time of mortgage closing. The HECM loan may also be used to purchase a primary residence. \u201cToday\u2019s positive report on the state of FHA will most likely renew calls for a reduction in FHA fees. It is a worthwhile conversation, but must caution that today\u2019s report again shows the vulnerability to the reserve fund posed by the volatility in the HECM book,\u201d Stevens told Housing Wire at the time, adding: Given the HECM volatility and recent concerns about liquidity in the Ginnie Mae market, these discussions should occur with an eye toward long term stability for the FHA program. We look forward to working with FHA to evaluate options that balance the need to ensure affordability for FHA borrowers, maintain actuarial soundness, and preserve stability in the Ginnie Mae mortgage backed security and mortgage servicing rights markets. At the time of the November report, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) supported such a cut, as did the Community Home Lenders Association (CHLA). \u201cFHA\u2019s actuarial report shows that the fund has indisputably found its footing,\u201d NAR President William Brown told Housing Wire. \u201cThe Community Home Lenders Association commends FHA for its solid financial results as demonstrated in its 2016 Actuarial Report  \u2014   and renews its call made in a letter last month for a further premium cut, to improve mortgage access to credit,\u201d the CHLA\u2019s executive director Scott Olson told Housing Wire. The NAR criticized Trump\u2019s executive order last week, as did a number of Democrats. But the CHLA left the door open for further review by Carson after his likely confirmation as Secretary of HUD. \u201cBased on the prior administration\u2019s lack of communication on the FHA premium reduction, we believe the decision to review such action prior to implementation is prudent,\u201d CHLA\u2019s Olson told Politico. \u201cWe are confident the review will support a premium cut,\u201d Olson added.","short_description":"Senate Committee to Vote on Confirmation of Dr. Benjamin Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Sex Robot Cafe To Open In London: \u2019Sex, Pastries - and Nothing More\u2019 - Breitbart","content":"Sex industry entrepreneur Bradley Charvet has revealed his plans to open a sex robot caf\u00e9 in London, where visitors will be able to receive \u201ccyber fellatio\u201d while drinking tea.

But while Trump said he didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s money, the billionaire businessman hasn\u2019t turned it away either. According to an analysis of the most recent finance reports by Crowdpac, a Silicon   political data site, Trump accepted roughly $14 million in campaign contributions through the end of April. Those donations came from 8, 200 individual donors. Trump\u2019s campaign received $57. 7 million through the end of April, in the most recent Federal Election Commission filing period. Of that total, nearly   of those funds came from loans that Trump has made to his campaign. The rest came from donors, according to the FEC. Crowdpac\u2019s analysis found that of the more than 8, 000 donors that gave to his campaign through April, 28% came from women, compared with 44% for all presidential candidates. Roughly 3% of Trump\u2019s donors are liberal, according to Crowdpac\u2019s ideological scoring.

He watched as a speaker introduced Aarti Thakur. She was dressed casually, wearing black jeans and a   top, and had a large scar on her neck.  Thakur was speaking about how    in January 2012    a man threw acid on her while she waited for a train in Mumbai, India\u2019s largest city.  It was the third time she\u2019d been attacked in under two months, by men she says were hired after she rejected a marriage proposal. For years afterward, she told the crowd, she had struggled with depression and fear on top of mounting medical bills.  An acid attack survivor himself, Pingale said listening to Thakur was a revelation. Her voice was clear and loud and strong. As she spoke he thought: \u201dThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s what I want in a life partner.\u201d  Gruesome crimes, In 2013, India increased the penalty for throwing acid on a person to 10 years in prison, and limited the sale of certain    acids.  But experts say attacks continue. \u201dWe haven\u2019t seen a deduction in incidents,\u201d said Mukul Varma, a regional director with the Acid Survivors Foundation India (ASFI).  Varma\u2019s team recorded at least 249 incidents in 2015, which he said was likely an underestimation as they rely on a network of survivors and hospitals to gather information, with no official figures available.  India\u2019s Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Home Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  According to ASFI, acid attacks result from a number of situations: family disputes, revenge, jealousy, mistaken identity and sex crimes, among others. Thakur said she was attacked after she rejected a marriage proposal from her landlord\u2019s son. She told the man she was already engaged, but he and his mother hired two men to attack her and disfigure her face, according to documents her lawyer filed with police. The case is currently in court, pending trial.  Heartbreak, Following the attacks, Thakur began volunteering with an organization which supports the survivors of acid attacks and was invited to speak at an event held by the Human Rights Law Network in November 2015.  It was there that she met Pingale. They became friends and would talk constantly, but she never expected that she wanted more.  Her former fiance, a man she had been with for five years, left her a few months after the attack. He stopped answering her calls and refused to see her, leaving her \u201dheartbroken\u201d and in a deep depression.  Thakur said she felt she was in no place to start dating again. But Pingale was already in love: he reached out to a mutual friend who communicated his feelings to Thakur.

In the subterranean world of the Beatrix gold mine, they shed their backpacks, taking out tools and meticulously prepared test tubes to collect samples. Leaning a ladder against the hard rock wall, Tullis C. Onstott, a geosciences professor at Princeton, climbed to open an old valve about a dozen feet up. Out flowed water   of microbes, organisms flourishing not from the warmth of the sun, but by heat generated from the interior of the planet below. These tiny    \u2014   bacteria and other microbes and even little worms  \u2014   exist in places nearly impossible to reach, living in eternal darkness, in hard rock. Scientists like Dr. Onstott have been on the hunt for life in the underworld, not just in South Africa but in mines in South Dakota and at the bottom of oceans. What they learn could provide insights into where life could exist elsewhere in the solar system, including Mars. Microbial Martians might well look like what lives in the rocks here at a deep underground mine. The same conditions almost certainly exist on Mars. Drill a hole there, drop these organisms in, and they might happily multiply, fueled by chemical reactions in the rocks and drips of water. \u201cAs long as you can get below the ice, no problems,\u201d Dr. Onstott said. \u201cThey just need a little bit of water. \u201d Mars has long been a focus of space exploration and science fiction dreams. NASA has sent more robotic probes there than any other planet. But now there is renewed interest in sending people as well. NASA has been enthusiastically promoting its \u201cJourney to Mars\u201d goal to send astronauts there in the 2030s. Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX, is promising that he will be able to get there a decade sooner and set up colonies. Astronauts on Mars would be able to greatly accelerate the quest for answers to the most intriguing questions about the red planet. Was there ever life on Mars? Could there be life there today? It was not that long ago that scientists had written off Mars as lifeless. Forty years ago, NASA spent nearly $1 billion on its Viking mission, which revealed a cold, dry world seemingly devoid of organic molecules that are the building blocks of life. But more recent missions have discovered compelling evidence that Mars was not always such an uninviting place. In its youth, more than three billion years ago, the planet was warmer and wetter, blanketed with a thick atmosphere  \u2014   possibly almost Earthlike. A fanciful but plausible notion is that life did originate on Mars, then traveled to Earth via meteorites, and we are all descendants of Martians. Eventually, Mars did turn cold and dry. Radiation broke apart the water molecules, and the lighter hydrogen atoms escaped to space. The atmosphere thinned to wisps. But if life did arise on Mars, might it have migrated to the underworld and persisted? For a couple of decades, Dr. Onstott has been talking his way into South African gold mines, regaling the mine managers with the wonder of deep Earth life to overcome their wariness. In many ways, the mines provide easy access to the depths  \u2014   a ride in a cagelike elevator, jammed against miners starting their shift, descending quickly as lights from the different levels zip past. Think of it as traveling through a   skyscraper, going down. Dr. Onstott and his colleagues had made repeated pilgrimages to this particular tunnel in this particular mine, Beatrix, 160 miles southwest of Johannesburg. When miners carve out new tunnels, they poke holes through the rock to see what surprises might lie ahead. Sometimes the borehole taps into a section of fractured rock with water coursing through. Then the fracture is drained and plugged. But this particular tunnel at Beatrix never entered production, so the borehole valve remains, allowing the scientists to return to draw samples from the same place. At this level, almost a mile underground, the elevator gates open to a   concrete cavern with the unremarkable plainness of a parking garage. A minirailway system transports miners and ore back and forth. The side tunnel, though, is pitch black save for the helmet lamps, and the trek to the valve is a slosh through muck and over tangles of mangled electrical cabling. Scientists led by Dr. Onstott made their most recent trip to South Africa in June last year. Over a couple of hours, they took their fill of the water and set up an apparatus that remains attached to the valve, trapping microbes, which were retrieved later in the summer. Since then, they have been analyzing the samples to understand this assemblage of life. The existence of what biologists now call the Earth\u2019s deep biosphere was unknown to almost all biologists at the time of the Viking mission. Life lived at the surface, in the soil or in the oceans. At the bottom of the food chain, the   primary producers, were plants and microbes that used photosynthesis and sunlight to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Other creatures ate the plants and microbes, and then larger creatures ate the smaller ones. In someplace that was always dark, it seemed obvious there could be no primary producers and therefore no life at all. Some scientists noticed close to a century ago this might not always be true. Edson S. Bastin, a geologist at the University of Chicago, wondered why some petroleum was \u201csour\u201d  \u2014   with high levels of sulfur that not only corroded pipes but also generated more pollution when burned. Bastin realized bacteria could do that, in particular a type of bacteria that does not need oxygen and eats sulfur compounds known as sulfates and excretes hydrogen sulfide  \u2014   the rotten egg smell  \u2014   and bicarbonate, the unwanted chemicals in sour crude oil. He and a colleague, Frank E. Greer, successfully cultured such bacteria from groundwater from an oil field, and Bastin speculated these could be descendants of bacteria that had been trapped in ocean sediments more than 250 million years ago. Other scientists contended that this must be a mistake, merely surface microbes on the drill that had contaminated the sample. In the late 1980s, the Department of Energy started a drilling project, carefully pulling up pristine cores from a couple hundred yards down. Bacteria, fungi and other microbes abounded in the cores. That spurred additional research and discoveries, including bacteria that lived in the heat of underground oil deposits and finally, a microbe that degraded oil as Bastin had predicted. Today, the deep biosphere is thought to account for 10 to 20 percent of mass of all life on Earth. Life, biologists also discovered, perseveres in other environments once thought sterile  \u2014   highly acidic water, highly alkaline water, highly salty water, boiling water around volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean. \u201cThe truth is it\u2019s virtually everywhere we look,\u201d Penny Boston, the director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, said in July at a panel celebrating the 40th anniversary of Viking\u2019s landing on Mars. Results from an earlier trip to Beatrix befuddled Dr. Onstott. He had expected the mine microbes to be feeding off organic matter dissolved in the water. In this picture, the ecosystem would be largely devoid of primary producers and instead subsist on leftovers, the detritus of long dead organisms washed down from above or deposited with the sediment 2. 9 billion years ago. \u201cThe only problem was that we didn\u2019t have any indication they were eating the organic matter in the fracture water,\u201d Dr. Onstott said. They figured out that the carbon molecules in the microbes came from methane, a plausible answer. Microbes known as methanogens consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide and produce methane other microbes known as methanotrophs eat methane. But the Beatrix water contained little of either. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense at all,\u201d Dr. Onstott said. \u201cIt made zero sense to us. \u201d Maggie Lau, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Onstott\u2019s laboratory, started examining the genetic snippets for clues of how the Beatrix community of microbes worked. With the newest data, it turned out there was a wider community of primary producer microbes, eating nitrogen and sulfur compounds. In essence, the waste of one microbe helped feed its neighbor, and only a little bit of methane, an   molecule, was enough to power the entire community. \u201cNow, for the first time, we\u2019re getting a true description of the ecosystem,\u201d Dr. Onstott said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a fairly common phenomenon. \u201d After working at Beatrix, the scientists went north, to the Limpopo region close to South Africa\u2019s border with Zimbabwe. There, they collected water from hot springs, whose source of water from far below should carry up underground microbes. One sampling site was in the middle of a small village where houses do not have plumbing and the spring, the hottest in South Africa, is a pond that serves as a communal spot for cleaning laundry. Another is a pool at a resort, once catering to the country\u2019s white minority. Surprisingly, the spring waters contained almost no microbes  \u2014   barely enough DNA to analyze. But water from two locations contained considerable amounts of methane, an encouraging sign. The methane is also a possible connection to Mars. A dozen years ago, three teams of scientists, one using data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Mars Express orbiter, the other two using observations from Earth, made the controversial claim of methane floating in the Martian atmosphere. That was a surprise, because sunlight and chemical reactions destroy methane any methane there would have had to have been released recently. There are two ways to produce methane. One is a geological process that requires heat and liquid water. The other is methanogens. Perplexingly, the readings of methane later vanished. As NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover drove across Gale Crater a couple of years ago, it too detected a burp of methane that lasted a couple of months. But it has not detected any burps since. Perhaps an underground population of methanogens and methanotrophs is creating, then destroying methane quickly, accounting for its sudden appearance and disappearance from the atmosphere. If Beatrix is a guide, the methane could be providing the energy for many other microbes. Conventional wisdom is that Martian life, if it exists, would be limited to microbes. But that too is a guess. In the South African mine, the researchers also discovered a species of tiny worms eating the bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s like Moby Dick in Lake Ontario,\u201d Dr. Onstott said. \u201cIt was a big surprise to find something that big in a tiny fracture of a rock. The fact it would be down there in such a confined space slithering around is pretty amazing. \u201d The odds of Mars life, past or present, are just conjecture. Even if life did arise on Mars four billion years ago and later migrated underground, could it have survived for four billion years? There are reasons to be skeptical. When low on water and energy, microbes can slow their metabolism or enter a state of suspended animation, able to revive when conditions improve. But many biologists doubt that such a tenuous hold on life could extend for a few billion years. Mars also lacks Earth\u2019s plate tectonics, a continual recycling of the outer crust of the planets that fractures rocks and exposes new minerals for microbes to eat. If life is deep underground, robotic spacecraft would not find them easily. NASA\u2019s InSight spacecraft, scheduled to launch in 2018, will carry an instrument that can burrow 16 feet into the ground, but it is essentially just a thermometer to measure the flow of heat to the surface. NASA\u2019s next rover, launching in 2020, is largely a clone of Curiosity with different experiments. It will drill rock samples to be returned to Earth by a later mission, but those samples will be from rocks at the surface. All this new interest in possible life on Mars is a sort of vindication for Gilbert V. Levin, one of the scientists who worked on Viking. Dr. Levin is sure he discovered life on Mars 40 years ago, and everyone else has been drawing the wrong conclusions from the Viking data. If he is right, then perhaps rediscovering life on Mars may require just scratching the surface. The two Vikings carried what was known as the labeled release experiment, developed by Dr. Levin and another investigator, Patricia A. Straat. Essentially, radioactive food made with unstable   was added to samples of Martian soil. The idea was that if microbes digested the food, the   would be released in a stream of radioactive carbon dioxide and other gases rising out of the soil. That is exactly what happened. Then other samples were heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit to sterilize them. If microbes were generating the radioactive gases, then there should be no gas rising from the sterilized soil. That, too, is what happened. \u201cThe response on Mars is well within the responses from terrestrial soils,\u201d Dr. Levin said, \u201cmost closely the Arctic and Alaska. \u201d But in the absence of organic molecules, other Viking scientists discounted the possibility of life. It was like claiming the existence of a city in a place lacking wood, steel, bricks or any other building materials. Dr. Levin has proposed, again and again, sending another labeled release experiment to Mars, to no avail. NASA\u2019s 2020 rover will be able to catalog a wide variety of organic molecules, but carries nothing to look for life directly. Dr. Levin may finally get his wish with ExoMars, a European rover scheduled to launch in 2020. He is working with one of the teams building one of ExoMars\u2019s instruments to see if it could be modified to incorporate the labeled release apparatus. There is a bit of a race against time. Dr. Levin, the last surviving member of the Viking biology team, is 92. \u201cAll I have to do is last that long,\u201d he said.","short_description":"Scientists explore deep underground mines in South Africa to study microbes that could provide insights into the possibility of life on Mars.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Report: Transgender Activists Attack Pro-Family Campaign Bus With Hammer, Paint - Breitbart","content":"  groups leased a big orange tour bus to highlight the big obvious  \u2014   but perhaps temporary  \u2014   fact that a person\u2019s male or female sex is decided by biology, not by politics.

The attack was inflicted after the conservative organizers had \u201ccall[ed] on all Americans to respect the free speech rights of citizens to debate these issues without fear of being demeaned, harassed, or threatened with retaliation. \u201d The #FreeSpeechBus tour began Thursday in New York, and it is being led by the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) International Organization for the Family, and CitizenGO. \u201cWe filed a police report and there is video surveillance\u201d of the two attackers damaging the bus and attacking the bus driver, Brian Brown, the director of the National Organization for Marriage, told Breitbart News. The attack took place near the United Nations building.  \u201cThey should be punished to the full extent of the law,\u201d he said. \u2018\u201cIt is a hate crime   \u2026     if it was motivated by our religious or political beliefs, it is under the statutes to be prosecuted as a hate crime. \u201d The attack \u201cproves our point  \u2014   that some on the other side don\u2019t believe in tolerance, they want to shut us down   \u2026    . [but] we\u2019re not stopping the bus tour,\u201d he said.  The bus tour is needed to spread the message nationwide that government must not promote the false claim that people can change their sex, said Brown.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing actual legislation trying to force schools to accept that boys can go into girls\u2019 restrooms  \u2014   that\u2019s absolute insanity,\u201d he said. State and federal approval of the transgender claim that people can and should be allowed to change their sex have created a   of medical specialists who are performing radical surgery on children, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking young children and essentially mutilating them   \u2026     this is horrific, and people need to stand up against this. \u201d Political advocates for the \u201cgender ideology\u201d idea say that biological sex has nothing to do with feelings of \u201cgender,\u201d that people can and should be allowed to change their legal sex as often as they wish and also that government can and should force other people to comply with the changing preferences of people who say they want to live as members of the other sex. For example, these activists say that biological men should be legally invited to use women\u2019s   and sports leagues, and children should be forced to refer to a boy as a girl if the other child wants them to do so.  The overall goal for the transgender activists is a \u201cgenderless society\u201d which no longer allows any social, civic or legal recognition of the   different, equal and complementary preferences of the two distinct heterosexual sexes, including the normal view of marriage as a man and a woman joining to become parents for the next generation of people. \u201cThe end of the [transgender] road is to say that fundamental reality is simply a subset of our wishes  \u2014   that if I wake up one day and say \u2018I\u2019m a boy [then] I\u2019m a boy,\u2019   \u2026     that\u2019s the big lie here,\u201d he said.    libertarians should recognize that \u201cif you [allow government to] change the fundamental nature of male or female persons, it can change anything  \u2014   and the government can try to coerce people to buy into their false version of reality,\u201d he said. The orange bus was leased to help share this argument with Americans and media outlets around the nation, he said  \u201cThe \u2018gender identity\u2019 activists have scared people from stating the obvious truth,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThe bus is letting people know they should not be afraid to stand against this nonsense,\u201d he added.  Polls show fewer than   of Americans support the claim that people should be allowed to freely change their legal sex without surgery or legal paperwork. Other polls show lopsided public opposition to demands that   bathrooms be replaced by shared bathrooms.   Advocates say that only 0. 6 percent of people are transgender. Critics highlight a study of the 2010 census which showed that only 89, 667 adults had changed their names from one sex to another. That\u2019s roughly 1 in 2, 500 adults.

Trump says try the meatloaf","content":"Washington (CNN) The White House kitchen can produce most anything, but it looks like President Donald Trump keeps running back to an old favorite: meatloaf. Tom Barrack, a longtime confidant of Trump, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201dOutFront\u201d Tuesday that he ate meatloaf with the President, days after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he had to do the same.

The lunch was terrific,\u201d Barrack said. \u201dThe meatloaf is incredible.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for an explanation as to why the meatloaf is so good. Christie ate with Trump at the White House on February 14, and afterward, he described the experience while hosting a radio show, saying the President made him eat the meatloaf. \u201dThis is what it\u2019s like to be with Trump. . ..

He and his wife, Melania, appeared on Martha Stewart\u2019s show in 2005, where they all prepared a meatloaf sandwich. He said at the time that a meatloaf sandwich was his favorite kind of sandwich. Trump\u2019s culinary preferences aside, Burnett also asked Barrack about the perceived \u201dchaos\u201d inside the White House that has appeared to define the first month of his administration. \u201dYou think it\u2019s being run this way purposely?\u201d Burnett asked, to which Barrack replied, \u201dThis is Donald Trump being Donald Trump.\u201d \u201dSo he wants the chaos?\u201d \u201dAbsolutely,\u201d Barrack said. \u201dHe is the best instinctive manager that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He continued: \u201dHis staff understands that.

This is 100, 000 years older than previously discovered fossils of Homo sapiens that have been securely dated. The discovery was presented in a study in the journal Nature on Wednesday.  This marks the first discovery of such fossils in north Africa, and widens the \u201dcradle of mankind\u201d to encompass all of Africa, the researchers said. Previous finds were in south or east Africa. The fossils, including a partial skull and a lower jaw, belong to five different individuals including three young adults, an adolescent and a child estimated to be 8 years old. Stone tools, animal bones and evidence of fire were also found within the same layer at the site. But what the researchers found to be most remarkable about these fossils is that they capture a moment in time of evolution. The facial features of the skull look like a modern human, but the brain case is very elongated and archaically characteristic of early humans.  There has been increasing evidence that the modern human lineage diverged from Neanderthals and Denisovans 500, 000 years ago, making us close relatives rather than direct descendants. Before this discovery, it was believed that the early modern humans we evolved from were in Africa 200, 000 years ago and looked very similar to modern humans. But what happened in between that time? This is still unknown, although the researchers suggest the possibility that there were multiple groups of hominins, or human ancestors, overlapping and having complex relationships. Because they didn\u2019t previously have fossil evidence of Homo sapiens from 300, 000 years ago, this helps to fill a small part of that gap in the fossil record. The fossils provide insight about this evolutionary time for Homo sapiens before the early modern stage 200, 000 years ago.  \u201dOur analysis convinced us that this material represents the very root of our species, the oldest Homo sapiens ever found in Africa or elsewhere,\u201d said   Hublin, lead study author, paleoanthropologist and professor at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.  \u201dWe confirmed that they display this surprising combination of very advanced features and more archaic conditions. It allowed us to envision a more complex picture for the emergence of our species with different parts of the anatomy evolving at different rates, some features being fixed very early in a modern way and others taking a longer time to reach the modern condition.\u201d  If we could see these Homo sapiens from 300, 000 years ago walking around today, they would look very similar to us    if they were wearing a hat, Hublin said. Their faces would be short, flat and retracted compared to Neanderthals, and even some of the dental aspects are similar to ours.  But that elongated skull would give them away as being not quite like us. Their brains, and specifically the cerebellum, wasn\u2019t shaped like ours. But based on the brain case they discovered, these Homo sapiens did have a larger cerebellum than Neanderthals. \u201dThe story of our species in the last 300, 000 years is mostly the evolution of our brain and in this time period, a number of mutations occurred affecting brain connectivity,\u201d Hublin said. How the fossils were discovered, East Africa has been considered the \u201dcradle of life\u201d for the origins and evolution of humans, but north Africa has been largely ignored in this aspect. A skull was found in Florisbad, South Africa, in the 1930s and originally dated to 260, 000 years ago, but it\u2019s fragmentary and the exact date is subject to debate, the researchers said. During the 1960s, mining began on top of a large hill of limestone in Morocco and when the miners hit a pocket of sediment, it partially collapsed to reveal a human skull, bones and stone artifacts. Initial research revealed the artifacts to be 40, 000 years old, although that didn\u2019t align with the features of the bones.  In 2004, efforts were made to clean up the site and excavate it in order to figure out its true age. It\u2019s been an active site ever since, and there is still more to be discovered, the researchers said. Hublin and Abdelouahed   of the National Institute for Archaeology and Heritage in Rabat, Morocco, found human and animal bones, stone flints and evidence of fire in a preserved layer of the site.  While this isn\u2019t the oldest evidence of fire, not many sites can document this back to 300, 000 years ago. And these fires were controlled, being created and used easily. The fire evidence on the animal bones and burnt flints were key.  Through a dating technique called thermoluminescence, which measures how long it\u2019s been since a material with crystalline minerals was heated or exposed to sunlight, they determined that the site was anywhere between 300, 000 to 350, 000 years old. This included other previous discoveries at the site.  \u201dThis was a \u2019big wow,\u2019\u201d Hublin said. \u201dWe realized this site was much older than anyone could imagine.\u201d This discovery, combined with a Homo sapien skull found in South Africa, challenges the theory that Homo sapiens were confined to east Africa.  \u201dI\u2019m not claiming Morocco became the cradle of modern humankind,\u201d Hublin said. \u201dRather, we would support the notion that around 300, 000 years ago, very early forms of Homo sapiens were already dispersed all over Africa. This is facilitated by the fact that between 330, 000  to 300, 000 years before present, Africa did not look like it does today and there was no Sahara Desert. There was a lot of connections between other parts of the continent.\u201d The Sahara was effectively \u201dgreen\u201d at the time, with open grasslands, groupings of trees, rivers and huge lakes and more wet and humid than it is today. This supported animal life like gazelles, zebras, wildebeests, lions and other big cats    all of which were discovered at the site through fossil evidence of animals that these Homo sapiens hunted.  The tools and fire evidence also point to this being a site linked with the Middle Stone Age. A period spanning a million and half years before this involved the use of large, heavy stone tools like hand axes and cleavers.  \u201dWhat distinguished the Middle Stone Age is a shift from large,   stone tools to an emphasis on producing stone flakes that were smaller and lighter,\u201d said Shannon McPherron, archaeologist  at Max Planck and one of the study authors. \u201dThey would transform these flakes into pointed forms that most archeologists think were part of weaponry, increased sufficiency in hunting at a distance, which was more effective and safer for the hunter.\u201d During the time these Homo sapiens lived, the site at the collapsed hill was actually a cave that provided shelter. Their findings paint a picture of a hunting encampment where people passing through the landscape would spend the night, take shelter and clean and consume the animals they hunted, McPherron said. There are also no nearby sources for flint, meaning that the Homo sapiens found their high quality raw materials elsewhere. McPherron believes that the flakes indicate that the hunters were sharpening and transforming the flints while they were in the cave.  What\u2019s next, Sequencing of the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes happened at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, but that won\u2019t happen with these fossils. Although they tried to extract DNA from them, it wasn\u2019t there, Hublin said. Ancient DNA has yet to be recovered from Africa because the fossils are too old and the conditions are too hot.  The researchers hope to return to Jebel Irhoud because there is still more to be excavated. But this discovery creates more questions about how, when and where we evolved.  Evolution was not a sudden shift, but a gradual accretion of features and a series of mutations affecting development, the researchers said. And due to environmental changes, it was happening sometimes in isolated populations other times, exchanges of genes and innovation occurred when populations came together, causing favorable mutations to spread through populations due to positive selection, Hublin believes.  This is the oldest known fossil to date    for now, Hublin said. And the center of origin for us as a species is still unknown. But this discovery widens the \u201dcradle of life\u201d from East Africa to the whole continent, Hublin said, and suggests that these evolutionary changes were happening across the continent at the same time. \u201dOur results challenge the preconceived notion of early modern humans in East Africa in many ways regarding the date of emergence of our species, the geographical conditions of this emergence and the conditions of the evolution of the early forms of Homo sapiens,\u201d Hublin said.","short_description":"Oldest Homo sapiens fossils found in Morocco, pushing back the timeline of human evolution by 100,000 years.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Joy Behar: Trump Is a \u2019Traitor\u2019 Who \u2019Should Be Brought Up on Charges of Sedition\u2019 - Breitbart","content":"Thursday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d   Joy Behar said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should be charged with sedition.

[\u201cIslamic State fighters opened fire inside Zaventem Airport, before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in the Maalbeek metro station. The attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded,\u201d the report continued.  Very few major media outlets have reported on the longer \u201cofficial statement\u201d from the Islamic State, which extensively quotes the Koran and Islamic law to justify the atrocity. \u201cWe have seen so many people in the social media claiming that The Islamic state was not justified in killing the French \u2018innocent\u2019 citizens in the blessed ghazwa in Paris, and that of the Brussels attack now,\u201d says the longer statement plucked from ISIS social media. Ghazwa is a term for holy war, more specifically the final holy war against infidels that ISIS believes will bring the end of history. \u201cWe have also seen some evil \u2018scholars\u2019  \u2014   scholars for the dollars  \u2014   quoting the textual evidences out of context. Today, we shall tackle this topic with evidences from the Koran and sunnah, and the ijma,  quotes from the scholars of the salaf,\u201d the statement continues. Sunnah is traditional Muslim law, based on the words and deeds of Mohammed. Ijma refers to a consensus of Muslim scholars on matters of Islamic law. The Salaf are the first few generations of Muslims, beginning with Mohammed\u2019s companions. In short, ISIS is mocking those who disagree with its interpretation of Islam as mercenaries for infidel powers, and citing the authority granted by Islamic law and tradition for its slaughter of unbelievers and apostates. \u201cFirst we want to make it clear to all that what makes the kafir\u2019s blood permissible to spill is not him fighting the Muslims, rather it is his \u201cKUFR\u201d that necessitates his killing. So if one asks, can you kill a Kafir (who does not fight Islam and muslims)? the answer is a big YES,\u201d declares the ISIS post, getting right to the point. There follows a lengthy citation of Islamic verse, which has Allah stressing that \u201cunbelievers\u201d should be treated exactly the opposite as \u201cbelievers\u201d in all things, using the example of funeral prayers. This \u201cMafhum  \u201d rule is interpreted, for example, to mean that because Allah forbade funeral prayers for dead infidels, then funeral payers for dead Muslims are mandatory. Another verse has Allah saying that if infidels \u201crepent and perform   and give Zakat, then leave their way free. \u201d   is praying to Allah, while zakat is a religious tax. ISIS concludes this means the only way for unbelievers to \u201crepent\u201d is conversion to Islam. Absent such a conversion, \u201ctheir blood would not be protected and would be legal to spill and their wealth would be halal to take. \u201d Halal means \u201cpermitted under Islamic law. \u201d \u201cAllah also has made the blood of every kafir legal to spill in the general ayah: \u201cSo when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush\u201d (  verse 5),\u201d the Islamic State continues. \u201cThe general ayah\u201d means \u201cbasic religious writing. \u201d Several more writings from Islamic scholars throughout history on the legality of murdering infidels are quoted, with some consideration granted to properly subdued infidels who pay the special jizya tax of submission to their Muslim overlords. The blood of infidels is compared to that of pigs and dogs. Also, ISIS says Allah has no patience for the idea of infidel  : \u201cAllah just said the mushrikeen (idolators) so he never differentiated the \u2018innocent civilians\u2019 from the \u2018fighting soldiers.\u2019 So who are we to differentiate the kuffar today?\u201d The statement directly challenges the common assertion that ISIS is abusing or misinterpreting Islamic law.   \u201cFor those that say that we mistranslate these Quranic verses of Jihad and Qitaal and we go against the \u2018known\u2019 \u2018ulamaa\u2019: then give them this audio by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Utheymin who they respect a lot who says exactly what we have said now,\u201d says the ISIS statement, referring to a prominent Saudi scholar of Salafist Sunni Islam who died in 2001. The recommended quote from Utheymin reads as follows: \u201cAnd the second (matter) is the forbiddance of killing women and children in times of war. But if it is said: \u2018If they (the kuff\u0101r) do this to us  \u2014   meaning that they kill our children and women  \u2014   Then do we then kill them?\u2019 The apparent [meaning] is that it is [permissible] for us to kill their women and children. And due to the generality of the Statement of Allah: \u2018Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him. \u2019\u201d Further quotes from Allah in Koranic verses are offered to support literal retribution for acts against Muslims, such as, \u201cSo whoever has transgressed against you, then transgress against him in the same way that he has transgressed against you. \u201d ISIS proceeds to justify the slaughter of infidel women and children by asking, \u201cSo how many Muslim women and children and old have the French Kuffar killed in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Muslim lands? ??? We have not yet settled the scores, a few hundreds ain\u2019t enough yet. \u201d The Islamic State writer sums up by saying the post is intended for \u201cthe one who cry and mourn on the death of the Kuffar, while the death hundreds of muslim men, women, old and children dying daily in the airstrikes don\u2019t effect them in any way. \u201d The missive ends with an   invocation of divine will, presented exactly as written:  MAY ALLAH ACCEPT THE EFFORTS MADE TO COLLECT THESE PROOFS N EVIDENCES N MAY HE UNITE THIS UMMAH UNDER ONE LEADER AND ONE BANNER, M MAY ALLAH GRANT IZZAH TO ISLAM N MUSLIMS EVERY WHERE ON THE EARTH N MAY HE GRANT VICTORY TO THIS RELIGION ESTABLISHING THE SHARI\u2019AH OF ALLAH IN EVERY CORNER OF THE EARTH.

Last year, it sold a 49 percent stake in Rolling Stone to BandLab Technologies, a   music technology company led by Meng Ru Kuok, the son of an Asian business magnate. \u201cI\u2019m sad to say goodbye to those people and to a great brand  \u2014   it\u2019s done wonders for us and our family,\u201d Gus Wenner, the chief digital officer at Wenner and the son of the company\u2019s founder, Jann S. Wenner, said in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s also an exciting day for us, and I\u2019m very excited to focus on the next chapter of Wenner Media and on the brands that we have where we see enormous growth potential. \u201d Like other celebrity publications, Us Weekly has struggled in the digital age. Once a powerhouse whose editors included Janice Min and Bonnie Fuller, the magazine had a roughly 30 percent decline in newsstand sales in the second half of 2016 from the same period a year earlier, according to publisher\u2019s statements filed with the Alliance for Audited Media. Us magazine was founded in 1977 by The New York Times Company in the vein of Time Inc. \u2019s People magazine, but the company sold Us three years later. \u201cNever acquire a company that you\u2019re embarrassed to tell your mother about. Or start a publication, in this case,\u201d Arthur O. Sulzberger, the newspaper company\u2019s previous publisher, once said about Us. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t our line of work, and we weren\u2019t very good at it. \u201d Wenner Media bought Us in 1985 and turned it into a weekly from a monthly in 2000 to compete more directly with People and Entertainment Weekly, another Time Inc. magazine. Us had a rough start as a weekly, however, and in 2001, Wenner sold a 50 percent stake in the magazine to the Walt Disney Company for about $40 million. Five years later, Wenner Media borrowed $300 million to buy the stake back, saddling itself with debt that has required significant annual payments. Gus Wenner said that the proceeds from the Us Weekly sale would go in part toward repaying the company\u2019s remaining debt. (Wenner used $25 million from the $40 million Rolling Stone deal last year for a special payment on the loan, according to credit reports.) The sale of Us Weekly is the latest sign of Wenner Media\u2019s struggles. Rolling Stone lost a defamation lawsuit in November over a widely condemned 2014 article about allegations of a gang rape at the University of Virginia. The magazine still faces another lawsuit related to the article. Without Us Weekly and its 110 staff members, Wenner Media will be significantly smaller. The magazine brought in 65 percent of the $330 million that Wenner Media generated in revenue for the year that ended in June, according to a report in October from Moody\u2019s Investor Service. Rolling Stone produced 27 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, and Men\u2019s Journal contributed 8 percent. By selling Us Weekly, Wenner Media has further shifted its business away from print. Last year, it introduced Glixel, a   site devoted to games, and the company has made a big effort to increase its digital advertising revenue to make up for declines on the print side.","short_description":"Us Weekly magazine is being acquired by American Media Inc., giving them a larger digital presence and celebrity gossip influence.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Nine Killed in Border City Gun Battles in Hunt for Gulf Cartel Boss","content":"REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  \u2014   Mexican police killed at least eight cartel gunmen and a taxi driver in the recent gun battles that have descended on this border city. Mexican authorities continue to hunt for an elusive leader with the Gulf Cartel. [Breitbart Texas has been able to confirm with Tamaulipas law enforcement officials that the recent gun battles have been the result of a series of raids aimed at capturing Julian \u201cEl Toro or Comandante Toro\u201d Loisa Salinas, the current leader of the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel.   The longtime Gulf Cartel leader recently made headlines when he had his gunmen hang two men from a pedestrian bridge next to a banner where he claimed that the Gulf Cartel was not behind a series of highway robberies and kidnappings that had recently plagued northern Tamaulipas. The violence began on Wednesday when according to information released by the Tamaulipas government a group of gunmen attacked law enforcement officials and then deployed road spikes in an attempt to evade capture. Breitbart Texas has been able to confirm that the gunmen were part of an escape tactic used to draw authorities away from valuable targets. The gun battle began when authorities were preparing to raid a series of stash houses used by cartel gunmen. During the gunfight, officers killed one cartel gunman and arrested two others.  The fighting continued on Thursday and Friday when a group of gunmen in an SUV attacked a squad of Mexican marines. The military personnel fought off the attackers, killing two gunmen while two others managed to flee. Inside the vehicle, authorities found a cache of weapons and tactical gear.  As Breitbart Texas reported, Mexican Marines used a helicopter mounted   on Friday to fight the heavily armed cartel gunmen. In another gun battle, groups of cartel gunmen forced their way into taxis and forced the drivers to move them. Mexican authorities spotted one of those taxis and tried to stop them. The gunmen began to fire at the military troops starting another gun battle that killed the two gunmen, an innocent taxi driver and another suspected gunman in a nearby field.

With the lack of funding in the 2017 budget, those concerns are growing. [Construction of President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall along the U. S.  Border is slated to kick off in June when 20 selected bidders will be asked to build prototypes based on the proposals they submitted, Breitbart Texas previously reported.  However, The Arizona Republic reports that some bidders are starting to have serious doubts with some already giving up on the project due to how poorly the government is managing details. Michael Hari, the founder of Crisis Resolution Security Services in Illinois, submitted a proposal but is now one of its skeptics. \u201cFrom the beginning it\u2019s not a serious process, it\u2019s not going to get the wall built,\u201d Hari said. \u201cRight from the   there were conflicts, there was not enough time given to it, to develop a reasonable process that would result in a wall getting built. \u201d Hari, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, described to the Chicago Tribune in April his vision and reasons for wanting to work on the border wall, which is about more than money. \u201cWe would look at the wall as not just a physical barrier to immigration but also as a symbol of the American determination to defend our culture, our language, our heritage, from any outsiders,\u201d Hari said. M3 Federal, a consulting firm for contractors that has over 40 years of experience working on government contracts, warned that Washington not have a specific concept in mind for what exactly they seeking, as evidenced by multiple changes made to the requests for proposals. \u201cThe fact that things are being delayed and the fact that there are seven amendments out there just verifies the fact that the government does not have a confirmed concept about what they want to put in place,\u201d said Patrick Malyszek, owner of M3 Federal. \u201cThe way the government is handling this is actually going to create a very high risk in terms of the overall project. \u201d Among those bidders who have already given up on the border wall project is Christopher Dillon, owner of a construction management company based in Alaska. \u201cFrom the outset of the project, I have been tracking it and it\u2019s a political stunt,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cIt\u2019s burning a lot of money. It\u2019s really jerking the contracting community around. \u201d Building a wall on the U. S.  Border was a hallmark for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. During the campaign launch at Trump Tower, he said, \u201cI would build a great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. \u201d Despite this promise, President Trump said that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the $1. 2 trillion spending bill that he signed on May 5 which included $0 for a border wall. President Trump has reassured supporters that the wall is going to get built despite the setbacks in the 2017 budget in which he blamed Democrats for being \u201cobstructionists. \u201d \u201cLook, the Democrats are obstructionists that\u2019s all they can do is obstruct. They have no leadership. And we have to agree, and I think both  \u2014   both sides agree, we have to keep government going, we don\u2019t want to shut government,\u201d he said.

Why not?","content":" (CNN) So Mick Jagger is about to become a father again. The singer has announced that child number eight    conceived with his    girlfriend Melanie Hamrick    is on the way.  Congratulations to Papa Stone    who has been a   since 2014. He\u2019s now 72 years young and even though he is still able to rock the free world (and give free concerts in the    world, as he did in Havana show last March) there are good reasons the rest of the world\u2019s   men should think twice about fathering children at that age.   We usually think about older parenting as an issue for women: It\u2019s easy to understand why they would not want to have children as they get older. A   report last year calculated the risk of death during child delivery in the United States at 1 per 1, 800. The risk is highest for older mothers, and that\u2019s partly why the female body at some point says, \u201dNo more\u201d (also known as menopause).  What\u2019s more, children of older mothers are subject to higher risks for genetic diseases. In the case of Down syndrome, that risk approaches an astounding 3% as women reach age 45.   will offer genetic screening to women planning a pregnancy at 35 or older, or who have other risk factors. And the ease of blood tests has many women well below 35 also getting genetic workups before or during their pregnancies.  While Hamrick is only 29, her doctor probably offered some of this testing, if not for any risk factor of her own, because her partner, Mick, is 72.  So what are the issues for older fathers? The   paternal age effect is linked to numerous genetic disorders (including Down syndrome) as well as the complicated mixture of nature and nurture that lead to a variety of other psychiatric and neurological problems. Studies demonstrate that children of older fathers are more likely to have autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and learning difficulties.  To take autism as an example, an Israeli study concluded that men over 40 were five times more likely to have children with autism versus men under 30.  Scientists are still theorizing about the precise genetic mechanisms at work here, but in general it\u2019s well understood that our cells have more trouble dividing without error as they age, and that includes the sperm produced in a man\u2019s testes. The cells in the testes that ultimately produce sperm, called spermatogonia, divide 23 times per year, with each division producing a new chance for error. That possibility for error is the same phenomenon that leads to many cancers.   Join us on Facebook. . Beyond genetic risk factors, choosing to reproduce in your later years means you\u2019re more likely to start suffering health setbacks as your child is reaching major milestones in his or her early life. Even if you\u2019re as healthy as Mick Jagger, who\u2019s planning a big show in Vegas this fall, this is an unavoidable consideration. There\u2019s no question that the illness and death of a parent imprints in unpredictable ways on children and teenagers.  We\u2019re all living longer and healthier, but the wealthy especially so. With access to more active and interesting lifestyles    bringing a wide range of mentally stimulating activities, as well as great diets, personal trainers, and easy access to the full range of the world\u2019s best health care    the rich are living especially well these days. If the general trend is to start raising our children later in life, it\u2019s not unexpected that people at the top end of the income scale may take this trend to the extreme.  But there are still natural limits for everyone, even in 2016.  Still, beyond facing the inevitability of a parent\u2019s frailty and death at some point, Mick Jagger\u2019s child will not want for anything. Unlike other older parents, Jagger needn\u2019t worry about providing for his children after he\u2019s gone. That\u2019s a rare situation.  Any child of the intrepid Rolling Stone is destined to have a unique life. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s best to think twice about forgoing birth control after becoming a grandfather.

[Sam won SEC   Player of the Year in 2013 for the Missouri Tigers and was projected as a   pick, but on the final draft day it appeared that he would not be selected. Yahoo sports reports that the NFL, fearing negative blow back from LGBT groups, orchestrated a deal with the Rams that if they drafted Sam, they would not have to appear on the scrutinizing summer HBO series, Hard Knocks.  Generally NFL teams loathe the show\u2019s intrusion of cameras and HBO production staff. They consider the coverage a major distraction during crucial   preparation.  If no team volunteers to be a part of Hard Knocks, the NFL has the right to choose a team that hasn\u2019t been featured on the show in the last 10 years. According to 590theFan, the NFL chose the Rams to pick Sam because of the team\u2019s proximity to the University of Missouri\u2019s campus and their faith in head coach Jeff Fisher\u2019s ability to handle the circus that would inevitably surround a team with the first self professed gay player. By picking Sam as the 249th pick of the   draft, the Rams effectively saved the NFL from a huge public relations fiasco. Two years later, the NFL returns the favor by announcing that the Los Angeles Rams will star in the acclaimed summer series Hard Knocks, but this time around the recently transplanted Rams embrace the intrusion of cameras. Coach Fisher remarked, \u201cThis is an exciting time for our franchise. Hard Knocks will be an outstanding way to bring our fans into our training camp and preseason, and give a glimpse of the hard work and dedication of our players, coaches and staff as we prepare for the 2016 season. \u201d Of course the cameras won\u2019t find former defensive end Michael Sam dragging down the quarterback in scrimmages, because the Rams waived the Texas native after trimming the roster to 53 players in 2014. Sam tweeted on Wednesday, when apprised of the 2014 agreement between the NFL and the Rams:  \u201cI am not surprised at all. \u201d I\u2019m not surprised at all https:  .   \u2014   Michael Sam (@MichaelSamNFL) March 23, 2016, Sam played for awhile on the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 practice squad in that same year but was eventually cut.

Trump were already racing to seize the political upper hand. With a manhunt still in progress before an arrest later in the day, Mrs. Clinton sought to shift the terms of the presidential contest back in her direction. She called Mr. Trump a \u201crecruiting sergeant for the terrorists\u201d and, from a rainy airport in White Plains, offered herself as a seasoned warrior against terrorism. Mr. Trump returned fire hours later, blaming Mrs. Clinton and President Obama\u2019s handling of immigration and the Iraq war for bringing terrorism to American shores. He called for vigorous police profiling of people from the Muslim world and drew a direct equation between immigration controls and national defense. The attacks could reframe the presidential race around stark questions of national security after weeks of   sniping between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton over more personal matters of character, transparency and medical records. The violence of the weekend is all but certain to ripple in the first presidential debate, set for next Monday at Hofstra University on Long Island. For both the candidates and their parties, the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend are a critical inflection point. Not since the Iraq war has the mantle of national security and protection been more vigorously contested than it has been in this campaign, or its textures more difficult to define. With seven weeks left in the campaign, the candidates\u2019 responses to an apparent terrorist plot on American soil could sharply alter voters\u2019 views not only of them but of the parties they lead. And both candidates set up extraordinary stakes, each asserting that the other was not only wrong on national security, but actively abetting terrorists in word or deed. It was Mrs. Clinton who appeared most determined to bend the moment to her advantage. Unlike most Democratic nominees, she has enjoyed an edge over her Republican opponent on issues of national security and foreign policy. Having faced a rocky stretch in the presidential race, punctuated by a bout of pneumonia, she appeared to welcome a renewed debate over terrorism. Before flying to Philadelphia to court younger voters, Mrs. Clinton held a news conference to call for \u201ccourage and vigilance\u201d in the face of terrorism, and warned that Mr. Trump was unprepared to keep the country safe. Citing former intelligence and counterterrorism officials who have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic remarks about Islam, Mrs. Clinton leveled an attack that might have shocked the political world in any other campaign: In addition to calling him a \u201crecruiting sergeant\u201d for terrorists, she accused him of giving \u201caid and comfort\u201d to the Islamic State with his campaign oratory. \u201cWe\u2019re going after the bad guys, and we\u2019re going to get them, but we\u2019re not going after an entire religion,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding, \u201cWe know that Donald Trump\u2019s comments have been used online for the recruitment of terrorists. \u201d It was the most drastic version yet of an attack Mrs. Clinton has tried out recently with increasing boldness: In an interview on Israeli television this month, she said the Islamic State was praying for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and she has warned that foreign adversaries could seek to sway the election in her opponent\u2019s favor. Mr. Trump, she said on Monday, has helped the Islamic State and other terrorist groups cast their attacks as part of a religious war between Islam and the West. \u201cThey are looking to make this into a war against Islam, rather than a war against jihadists, violent terrorists,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThe kinds of rhetoric and language Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries. \u201d Mr. Trump responded with indignation. His campaign released a string of statements expressing outrage, criticizing Mrs. Clinton for favoring more lenient immigration policies and calling her attack on Mr. Trump tantamount to an accusation of treason. At a rally in Florida on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump blasted Mrs. Clinton for failing, as a member of the Obama administration, to stop the rise of the Islamic State, employing much the same     argument he has used to demand an overhaul of government on domestic matters. \u201cHer weakness, her ineffectiveness, caused the problem, and now she wants to be president,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. \u201d Mr. Trump directly equated American vulnerability to terrorism with what he called laxness in the immigration system. He has mainly warned about the risk of admitting refugees from Syria and other   countries, though the suspect arrested in the weekend attacks, Ahmad Khan Rahami, is a naturalized citizen born in Afghanistan and has lived in the United States for years. \u201cThese attacks, and many others, were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system,\u201d Mr. Trump said, trying to return the political debate to the issue he is most comfortable discussing. \u201cImmigration security,\u201d he added, \u201cis national security. \u201d But Mr. Trump may have to clear a higher standard than merely keeping up, punch for punch, with Mrs. Clinton. While he has drawn close to her in the polls, he still faces broad reservations among voters about his readiness to serve as commander in chief. In the past, he has provoked a backlash after terror attacks by fulminating against Muslims and shifting too quickly onto the offensive. If Mr. Trump finished the day with a forceful speech denouncing Mrs. Clinton, he began with a meandering telephone interview with Fox News, during which he asserted that there were \u201cmany foreign connections\u201d to the weekend attacks, though none had been established. And he suggested, again without supplying evidence, that American police officers fail to act against terrorism suspects because of political correctness. Mr. Trump also applauded himself for having described the Saturday night explosion in New York City as a bombing even before the police did. \u201cI should be a newscaster,\u201d he said. \u201cI called it before the news. \u201d The hostilities between the candidates erupted at the start of a week when both were aiming to cut a presidential profile and to strengthen their credentials on the international stage by meeting with foreign leaders in New York at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly. In many respects, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign against Mr. Trump has flipped the traditional contours of defense politics, offering voters a Democrat with more hawkish instincts and deeper ties to the national security establishment, and a Republican who has broadly rejected military intervention and has been spurned by many defense leaders in his own party. Mrs. Clinton is by far the more conventionally experienced and credentialed candidate, and in some respects is more hawkish: She has called for the creation of a   zone in Syria, as well as more airstrikes there, and has urged closer collaboration with Silicon Valley to expand the United States\u2019 surveillance capabilities, alarming some civil liberties advocates. In Mr. Trump, she confronts a candidate who has been abandoned by most of his party\u2019s national security elite, who is still unable to produce a detailed set of proposals for stopping terrorism, and whose essential political brand  \u2014   disruption  \u2014   does not always comfort voters seeking strength in moments of crisis and terror. Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama, said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the \u201cmommy party\u201d and Republicans as the \u201cdaddy party\u201d in American politics, then \u201cTrump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week. \u201d Mr. Trump has also cast doubt on American participation in NATO and spoken warmly of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and strongman. And in recent days, he has feuded with Robert M. Gates, a highly regarded former defense secretary, and found himself mocked by another respected national security figure, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who called Mr. Trump \u201ca national disgrace and an international pariah\u201d in private emails released by hackers last week. Whatever doubts many voters still have about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, most appear to consider her better suited to manage foreign policy and threats to the American people. Before the Chelsea bombing, according to a New York   News poll, voters gave her a slight edge on the question of who would better handle terrorism and national security, and a large one on foreign policy. Some polling suggests that she has a bigger lead over Mr. Trump on related questions  \u2014   who would be a better commander in chief, for example  \u2014   than past Democratic nominees have had over Republicans. \u201cVoters look for the qualities of experience, temperament and judgment,\u201d said Evan McMullin, a former intelligence officer who is running for president as a conservative independent candidate. \u201cHillary Clinton and Donald Trump lack some or all of them. But Trump lacks all of them. \u201d","short_description":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump engage in a heated political battle following a bombing in New York.","generated_by":"Human"},{"title":"Here\u2019s your full preview of a jam-packed week for the US economy","content":"\u2019The  (at 0%) on Friday  \u2014   emblematic of the tight range the stock market is stuck in.\u2019 \u2019Stocks last broke new highs in July 2015.

No, that\u2019s not a typo. It\u2019s 9:06, on the dot, every single morning.\u201d \u201dSee, what appears to be another lavish startup perk turns out to be an effective trick to make the company\u2019s programmers more productive.\u201d \u201dThe problem, Mee says Pivotal was finding, is that if left to their own devices, programmers are late risers. It was common for Pivotal\u2019s engineers to roll into the office around 10 or 11 in the morning. They\u2019d get in to the office, maybe send a few emails . .. and then almost immediately break for lunch.\u201d \u2019\u201dThe morning was too short, and wasn\u2019\u2019t very effective,\u201d explains Mee.\u2019 \u2019So Pivotal decided to employ both a stick and a carrot. The stick is a mandatory morning meeting at 9 a. m. where your absence will likely be noted. The carrot is the breakfast buffet, \u201dsort of a prize to get in,\u201d Mee says.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 \u2019But then Pivotal employees started to get a little anxious. If they hit traffic, or their bus broke down, or whatever else can go wrong with a commute, there was no wiggle room. And so it was decided that the meeting should be at 9:05 a. m.\u2019 \u201dThis, too, presented a problem: Mee says that developers would tell him that 9:05 was so close to 9 o\u2019clock that it didn\u2019t actually feel much later. Making it 9:06 a. m. apparently addressed the issue. The extra minute makes Pivotal\u2019s employees feel less like they\u2019re rushing. And so, the 9:06 a. m. daily breakfast meeting was born.\u201d \u201dI didn\u2019t get to sample the buffet  \u2014   I had already eaten breakfast, and I\u2019m not a .
